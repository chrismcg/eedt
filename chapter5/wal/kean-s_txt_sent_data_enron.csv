teams Kim and I previously met to discuss current activity for the Public 
Affairs and Administration group  Kim can be reached at ext   Kims

My team and I have truly enjoyed working with the  Public Affairs and 
Administration Group over the past  years   We have learned a great deal 
and even logged a few miles to fro Washington DC and San Francisco during 
the course of this partnership  It has all been a pleasure and I wish each 
of you the best

Effective August  I will assume the Director of Staffing role for the

Followup

Steve  

Following up on our conversation Friday we have advised Cliff Baxters 
Assistant that effective immediately Cliff and his quests can pass through 
Security on the Plaza without showing his access card or requiring his 
quests to sign in or identify themselves  All he needs to do is approach the 
front Reception Desks and asking for entry  The receptionists will recognise 
Cliff by sight and ensure that he and his quests pass through  without delay 
 by lifting the adjacent rope

We are asking Cliff to use his badge at the card readers as per standard 
procedure when he is entering the building by himself

We are also refining procedures and upgrading our IT systems data base @ the 
Reception Desk to make it easier on a visitor of any employee  For example 
if you call down to the Plaza Reception Desk and advise that a visitor is 
expected the receptionist will have a pass prepared so as to eliminate the 
sign in process  The guest simply has to exchange their business card for 
the visitor pass  Or if an employee shows their access card at the Reception 
Desk and asks that their guest gain entry that guest can get a badge without 
signing in  Again we ask that the guest exchange their business card for a 
visitor pass

We are  working on installing a new data base @ the Desk that will pull up a 
digitised photo of the employee duplicate of whats on their badge on the 
screen  This will allow employees to get a temporary access badge without 
showing other ID and will speed process

Finally we are testing a small proximity access card which is designed to be 
a duplicate backup for executives  It is sized to fit on a key chain and 
works with our standard card readers

Dear Joe

communications from Warren RoBold This totals  between both
individuals and the Corporation for the RNSEC matching funds program We want
these funds matched in time for the Texas State deadlines It was our
intention from the onset of this program to have our funds go to this
account The various points of contact from the RNC caused some minor
confusion so checks went to Texas instead of DC This is very important to

        Let us know if we need to request these funds returned and new checks
written and mailed to you at your DC address You may call me if you have any

Subject Idea


AEP ComEd Duke and CPL announced last week that they would be 
collaborating on a new version of a net based system better than OASIS  I 
think that Enron should consider joining with these utilities on this  There 
may be substantial Enron upside to such a venture from added information 
disclosure and standardization and streamlining for easier use

On   FERC issued an Advance NOPR asking for input by    on OASIS 
Phase II the new OASIS proposal  In particular FERC states that this new 
OASIS should address i communication of critical market information like 
transmission rights ii posting of ATC TTC and CBM and ii seams 
issues between RTOs transmission service across multiple RTOs  FERC says 
that the new OASIS should make use of Internet interactive displays etc  
FERC also asks for information on dynamic notification where the OASIS 
automatically alerts the customer to changes in ATC reservations etc  
This type of functionality would allow Enron to determine if it wants to stay 
in a queue when transmission becomes available rather than getting kicked 
out after the first denial for lack of ATC  FERC also wants information on 
whether generatorrun status should be included on OASIS electronic 
scheduling which can now be done via etag and business practices that 
should be standardized
Enron could have significant input to force these utilities to propose a 
good customer friendly system that provides valid and helpful data on ATC 
TTC and CBM rather than the total lack of substantive information that is 
available today  Recall that Enron proposed that CBM use be postedFERC 
has not adopted that idea yet
Because these are critical utilities any system that they propose may be 
very likely to be adopted with some changes  I think it is better to be in 
on the front end  Enrons participation would also give validity to their 
system
Dan Larcamp told me that he would like more classes for his staff from 
Enron and that we should give joint classes with AEP because Susan Tomasky 
told Dan L that AEP has nothing to hide  This type of venture would allow 
AEP one venue to make good on that statement
Steve K asked us to pursue the idea that Enron build a computer system  
This may be a good way to have significant input while leveraging these 
companies money and promoting Enrons congestion model ideas etc

Joe

Although I dont have his bio Ive known Herve Joanjean for about  years
He has served in the EU mission t the WTO as a mid level market access
negotiator and in Brussels mostly on industrial goods market access
negotiations  His move to Madelins job is a lateral one from the
industrial goods side to the services side of DGTrade

In the mid s I worked with Herve quite a bit and found him to be
trustworthy and conscientious  He was a pleasure to work with and although
we will miss having Robert in the Services position Herve is a good
replacement

Bob Vastine reports that Robert Madellin will be moving from the Services
portfolio this fall to Agriculture and some other high sounding
responsibility He is being succeeded by Herve Jouanjean with Michel Servoz
as number  Does anyone have biographical information on Herve
Jouanjean

Andrew Buxton who heads the European Services Network will be here for
meetings with CSI and ISACs this week and also in NYC with CSI and
Japaneese counterparts Bob told me that Vivendi is the only energy
interest involved as members of Andrews group and they have expressed no
interest in liberalized energy services This would seem to be an
opportunity for the UK electricity association to advise him of their
interests and possibly the drilling people

During the ISAC  meeting last week USTR Peter Collins reported that the
WTO Working Party Dealing With Chinas accession had expressed concern with
the recent negotiation in which the Chineese won a series of exemptions and
in the case of energy services and possibly ecommerce there are price
controls  We were told that a number of law firms in Washington are
opposing any USTR acceptance of this provision and Bob Vastine informed
ISAC  members should they have a view on price controls

Trade Ministers will meet in September and are likely to ratify the China
accession regardless of the WTO Working Group issues  You need to let us
know if Enron should consider filing a statement regarding price controls
for energy services and ecommerce services

Subject Canary Wharf  Update for Executive Committee

John  as requested You may wish to top and tail this



Enron continues to expand aggressively in Europe  Forty Grosvenor Place our 
European Headquarters continues to accommodate this expansion but the long 
lead times involved in obtaining premises in London require us to evaluate 
the future accommodation requirements of the business now 

We are considering a number of scenarios and have reviewed all currently 
available sites within a  mile radius of Central London Ideally we would 
be looking to accommodate all Enron employees in one building and we require 
significant swing capacity to expand or contract the space available 
depending on our business requirements

One of the options currently available is a site being developed by Canary 
Wharf in Londons Docklands We have been looking to secure an option on this 
site so that we may properly evaluate the opportunity and consult with our 
employees

On Friday  July we agreed nonbinding Heads of Terms with Canary Wharf for 
the letting of m sq ft This was a prerequisite to obtaining exclusivity 
whereby we have until  September to negotiate contractual terms or walk 
away from the deal

We will continue to evaluate other options and there is clearly no 
commitment to conclude a deal with Canary Wharf

An announcement was made to employees at the all staff update last Thursday 
attached

Media speculation has forced Canary Wharf to issue a London Stock Exchange 
Announcement confirming that we have agreed outline terms on a potential 
letting and that discussions continue

Yesterday morning during the allemployee staff update Fernley Dyson on 
behalf of John Sherriff provided staff with an update on the impact Enrons 
rapid growth in Europe is having on our overall space needs at Enron House  
It was acknowledged that this is an important subject and one about which 
many employees have a lot of questions 

The message was clear  In the day to day decisionmaking process about Enron
s commercial activities it is critical to understand what options are 
available and to keep as many avenues open as possible  In turn it is 
equally important to take this same approach when looking at Enrons future 
office space requirements

What is the bottom line

Looking to the future the preference would be for all Londonbased employees 
to be housed in a single location

One of the options under consideration is Canary Wharf but we must stress 
that no decision has been taken at this time

We are currently evaluating all the options available to us in the London 
property market

If we are to move to a new building it will not occur before 

We will be seeking input and feedback from employees as part of the 
decisionmaking process

We are committed to keeping the channels of communication open and to provide 
information to employees on a timely basis

This reception is an opportunity for us to update city officials about Enron

because it could limit our ability to move power to other markets in the west

In addition if you get questions from the analysts on reregulation or 
price caps it is worth pointing out that the high prices prevailing in many 
markets help our retail sales pitch to end use customers and create 
opportunities for our wholesale price risk management services     even a 
 price cap is  times what large customers are accustomed to paying

Subject FERC Order on Morgan Stanley Complaint Against ISO


We have good news on the ISO price caps front  The FERC has made it
clear that ISO does not have the ability to mandate that generators sell to 
ISO at its price caps and that the proper response to inadequate supply is to 
lift the price caps

On Friday the FERC issued its Order on Complaint in connection with the July 
 complaint filed by Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc MS  As you may 
recall MS requested FERC to issue a stay of the ISOs maximum purchase price 
authority and to direct the ISO to reverse any price cap reductions  MS 
sought Fast Track processing pursuant to Rule h which was granted by 
FERC on the grounds that the complaint warrants expeditious action

As a quick background summary for you last November FERC issued an order 
approving Tariff Amendment  which extended ISOs price cap authority 
through     That order stated that the ISO maximum purchase price was 
not a cap on what the seller may charge the ISO but a cap on what the ISO 
was willing to pay  The Commission said that sellers dissatisfied with the 
price cap could choose to sell those services into the California Power 
Exchange or bilateral markets

FERC notes in Fridays Order that the   the ISOs Board resolution lowered 
the caps to  and ISO further directed that To the extent permitted by 
law regulation and preexisting contract Management shall direct generators 
to bid in all their capacity when system load exceeds  MW

The MS complaint alleged that the cap reduction was unlawful and would 
threaten the stability and integroty of the marketplace  MS also requested 
an emergency technical conference to examine ISOs justification for the 
price cap reduction

FERC denied the MS stay request as well as its request that the  maximum 
purchase price be reinstated  The Commission reiterates that it is not 
approving a cap on sellers prices because they can sell at whatever price 
they want  Rather ISO has simply stated the maximum price it is willing to 
pay  Because sellers are not required to sell to the ISO the ISO cannot 
dictate their price

Importantly however FERC also states that ISO has no more or less ability 
to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these servicesif 
the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced 
purchase price ceiling because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they 
choose it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to 
meet its needs  Emphasis added  FERC then notes that this may lead to an 
increase in Out of Market OOM calls and that OOM calls are not subject to 
a maximum purchase price

Also with regard to the ISOs resolution stating that generators must bid 
their capacity into the ISO markets when system load exceeds  MW FERC 
states clearly that such a requirement is not permitted by our November   
Order and the ISO tariff  Emphasis added

FERC goes on to say that any requirement to sell to ISO in conjunction with a 
maximum purchase price would require significant revisions to ISOs market 
rules which could not be made effective without a corresponding amendment to 
ISOs tariff  This would require  days advance notice and could not be 
implemented prior to Commission approval  As stated above our November  
Order was clearly based on the premise that the proper response to inadequate 
supply due to a low maximum purchase price is to raise the maximum purchase 
price

ISO is then put on notice that any amendment to mandate sales must be 
accompanied by a demonstration that this extreme measure is the proper 
response to low supplies in the ISO markets

Concurrences were filed by Commissioners Massey and Hebert  Massey suggests 
that the state has to facilitate solutions to market issues such as risk 
management tools removing constraints on hedging opportunities introducing 
real time pricing through real time metering and expediting approval of new 
generation and transmission projects in California  Hebert says that the 
previous November Order tried to straddle the fence and that Today the 
Commission at least starts to lean slightly in the right direction of 
recognizing that we have a role  He then reiterates his preference for 
removing all price caps  He also suggests that Getting to the bottom of 
the problem in my view requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our 
approval of the ISO as operator of the California grid  The record supports 
such a move  He refers approvingly to the Collins resignation letter 
stating that it thoughtfully outlines consequences to the market of a 
return to command and control   Hebert states that The independence of 
the ISOs governing structure stands threatened  We should stand up to 
quote the resignation letter  Hebert advocates opening a section  
proceeding now as part of the recently announced inquiry into bulk power 
markets including the California markets

This decision makes it clear that ISO cannot lower the caps at tomorrows 
meeting and expect that sellers will be required to sell to it at that 
price  This is an important development and very good news in our ongoing 
efforts to seek economic sanity at the ISO

Please call if you have any questions

Mary  please give some thought to how we might solicit employee views on 
this
Cindy  I believe we already allow matching of donations to quasireligious 
organizations religious schools for example and perhaps relief 
organizations like Catholic Relief Services  I think that if we want to 
consider extending it we should probably discuss it in a smaller group than 
the espeak forum   the Enron Foundation Board perhaps  This could become 
controversial though recall the Planned Parenthood debate and the periodic 
attempts of shareholders to add restrictions through the proxy mechanism

Subject CNN Link Update

Steve

I spoke with Margaret and she mentioned she also takes the same route as Ive 
started to obtain the electronic link for CNN stories profiles of Enron  
Although the contract looks like it only allows us Intranet use and not 
Internet use as well  This premise was confirmed by Margaret too because 
she recalls paying  for a Intranet Internet video link and only 
 for a Intranet link  My unsolicited recommendation would be to 
purchase the external link as well as the internal link  I believe we would 
get a lot of mileage out of posting this link on our website  with 
downloadable supporting software  to allow users to view the video  From a 
PR perspective I would refer  of incoming inquiries to our site as well 
as sending them general company info  Also it would unequivocally 
illustrate and promote why Enrons has been voted Most Innovative Company 
for five consecutive years in a row

Nowenough of my blabber and to the pointI am still waiting to hear back 
from CNN to assess exact pricing for both types of links  Ive placed two 
followup calls but have not yet heard anything  If you have any questions 
please do not hesitate to inquire with me

Jeff

This is all Ok after the fact but I would have expected that we would have 
discussed this before action was taken 

For the record I would not advise calling this an arbitration BUT mediation 
and I would work with senior government officials and politicians ahead of 
time to control the fall out that may come about especially since Parliament 
is in session right now

I will advise our PR group to say nothing to the press but route all queries 
to you

Subject Arbitration with Reliance and ONGC

I was in India last week meeting with partners and we all agreed that the 
best thing to do to move ahead regarding the old unrecovered cash calls 
joint interest billings was to file an arbitration proceeding and get an 
objective  third party to settle the issue  As you know Reliance and ONGC 
owe EOGIL approximately   and  million respectively including 
interest on nonpayment  The arbitration notices reflected only the 
nonpayment numbers which are  and  million for RIL and ONGC 
respectively   We finalized the drafting and dated the notices on July th 
and we delivered the official notice during business hours Monday July  
  This was the final step in a very long effort to resolve this issue in 
other means but as I noted to the OOC after the June meetings this was the 
only solution in the end   While nobody likes to file arbitration the good 
news is in the end all parties seen this as the only solution and as best as 
I can tell at least internally ONGC and Reliance support this decision  If 
the issue gets external I dont know how any of the parties will respond  
Our goal is to keep it as low keyed as possible but this is India and I 
would expect someone to try to make a big issue out of it

I will be in contact with John Ambler today to discuss the details of the 
submittal and to prepare for any response to the media that may be 
necessary  While both parties were expecting the notice it may leak into 
the media over the next few days  Please defer any questions or comments to 
either John Ambler Larry Morse or myself regarding this issue  Until John 
advises us otherwise our comment will be as follows

 The parties ONGC Reliance and Enron Oil and Gas India Limited have had a 
dispute on certain cost items and together we have agreed it is best for the 
joint venture to have this dispute resolved by an independent third party 
using the guidelines as set forth in the Joint Operating Agreement

Mike Smalling in our office will coordinate this matter with John Ambler and 
the appropriate staff   I will be available to respond if necessary and my 
contact numbers are as follows

office
pager 
cell 
home 

Larry please make sure our office understands that only you are to comment 
on this and any other official EP business in India and Wade Sanjay would 
you share this note with the appropriate people in your office so nobody is 
surprised if something comes up  Mike Smalling John and or I will keep you

Subject Bahamas LNG

Steve 

In a discussion today with Mike Kelly etc it was apparent that the Public 
Affairs team viewed the Bahamas LNG transaction quite cautiously  Given the 
recent issues power plant development has had in Florida big political 
fights that are going the wrong way I was wondering if it made sense to 
bring together a meeting of all of Public Affairs and the deal team to 
analyze the implications of our development plans  My primary worry is that 
P L under water could have severe ecological implications that are not being 
internalized into the transaction

I would like to try and arrange a meeting to  ensure Public Affairs 
coordination and  understand the deal impacts better 

Please advise if Im worrying for no good reason

		 Subject Conversation with Wanda Curry


	


Today Mary Joyce and I met with Wanda Curry  I realize that there is some 
concern that Wanda is a litigation threat so for the purposes of soliciting 
legal advice and in anticipation of litigation I am forwarding my 
recollection of todays meeting to you

Wanda remains very emotional about what she perceives as unfair and 
discriminatory treatment  When I asked her what she meant specifically and 
did she intend those terms to have their legal meaning she said that she 
did not intend the legal meaning of those terms  rather she on  a 
personal level  felt that the company should have treated her better  She 
mentioned specifically that no one ever called to explain in detail why she 
had not been further promoted at Enron or given more responsibility at Enron 
that she viewed the job in Sally Becks organization as unsatisfactory 
because Sally should be treated as a peer not a superior and that she 
felt as though she did not have the support of upper management of the 
company
I described several options for her
Take the job she was offered in Sally Becks organization
Take the job in Rick Buys organization I said I would have to talk to Rick 
again
Take severence under the standard package
Take severence as a business reorg but consult with Enron for a period
At first she seemed most interested in the fourth option although she wasnt 
particularly happy about any of the  alternatives but at the end of the 
discussion expressed interest in the second option
A large part of the conversation involved discussion of Wandas complaints 
about how she had been treated  Most of Wandas concerns focussed on jobs 
she did not get or jobs she felt were taken from her reduced scope of 
control and the fact that she felt that her supervisors did not communicate 
with her sufficiently prior to or subsequent to making their decisions about 
job assignments  I suggested that there were likely two sides to the story 
and that most of the problem was insufficient communication or perhaps some 
insensitivity  I also pointed out that in all my conversations I heard good 
things about her performance and had no indication that anyone had treated 
her unfairly
Wanda did complain about many things but never once complained about her pay 
at Enron

Mary these are my recollections from today  Do you have anything to add

We were considering moving to a  Peer Group Structure however it as agreed 
at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since 
the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most 
activities had been placed with the exception of just   or  It was agreed 
that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an 
organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to  Peer Groups All

 to review and agree the attached mapping 

    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in

Subject Presidential Power Question

I spoke with Donna Bobbish this morning about Steves question  does the 
President have broader authority to take action during times of crisis  
Donna sent me this quick write up about what she has looked into so far  
Because these questions go beyond a FERC practitioners expertise we asked 
Donna to work with a Constitutional Law expert at VE to determine whether 
and under what circumstances the Presidents authority may be extended 
beyond the authorities discussed in the memo  

We will let you know what we learn from that further research

briefly when you first gave me the assignment  I read an interesting law
review article  on The Imposition of Martial Law in the United States for
a discussion of presidential powers  There is no general emergency
authority granted the President in the US  Constitution  Also the
article discussed the famous Truman steel mills case Youngstown Sheet 
Tube Co v Sawyer  US   in which the Supreme Court declared
unconstitutional President Trumans seizure of the steel mills during the
Korean War  In that case in light of a threatened nationalwide strike in
the national steel industry President Truman concerned about the national
defense issued an Executive Order directing the Secretary of Commerce to
take possession of most of the steel mills and keep them running  The
Supreme Court said that if the President had authority to take such  an
action he had to derive it either from an act of Congress or the
Constitution itself  Since the Supreme Court could not find any seizure
authority it invalidated the Presidents action  The Supreme Court also
rejected the argument that the President had any powers that could be
implied from the aggregate of his powers under the Constitution

Based on the Truman steel mills case I thought it the wiser course of
action to look for specific authorities given to the President by statute
which might prove useful

I could look into this question further if you would like but we would be
entering martial lawtype legal territory where the President would be
acting outside of specific Constitutional or congressional authority which
has been described a zone of twilight and in light of the Truman steel
mills case I dont know how fruitful that might be

Please let me know if you would like me to do anything more  Thank you

Steve

Attached is information about a conference sponsored by the Association of 
Energy Services Professionals International AESP taking place this August  
We received a request for an EES Executive speaker for the Symposium but 
felt that it would be more appropriate for an Executive from Corporate to 
consider speaking here  There are Executives from companies such as The New 
Power Company Cinergy and Entergy committed to speaking at the event  More 
information can be found in the document below

Please let me know if you have questions or comments

that we had been hearing that El Paso was blaming Enrononline for problems in 
Western gas markets  He asked for some more specifics about who exactly was 
spreading the rumor I told him we had heard it from  sources  He 
acknowledged that EOL was not the problem said he couldnt believe that it 
had been identified as such and said he would bring it up on his call with 
his Washington team this afternoon

I think he will put it to rest except for whatever damage has already been 
done  I did promise to get some more specifics on who has told us that El 
Paso pointed to us  Can anybody give some info on that"

was evolving over the course of last week  As you pointed out the Japanese 
utilities view us as just another annoying US company who is going to come 
in bang its head against the wall for a few months and then leave  We need 
to continue to reinforce the message that not only are we not going away we 
are starting other businesses here to keep us going while we continue to 
agitate for reform in the electricity sector

Subject Translation  Nikkan Kogyo   Enron Mentioned

To date reports on Enrons role in California have been limited to a reprint 
of a Sacramento Bee article appearing in the Denki Shimbun  a limited 
circulation publication sponsored by the Japanese utilities Last Friday Mr 
Ohta President of Chubu Electric and Chairman of the Federation of Electric 
Power Companies made some uninformed comments at a regular energy press club 
briefing about Enrons commitment to its Californian customers  Ohta will be 
retiring from both positions in two weeks 

In the past both Chubu Electric and the Federation of Electric Power 
Companies have distanced themselves from Mr Ohtas public comments which are 
generally considered to be ultra conservative and unsupported by facts As a 
result we have tended to ignore his comments However on this occasion I 
think we need to set the record straight on Enrons role in California I 
would welcome your thoughts on whether we should let the comments pass or 
respond

Over the past few months we have received various statements from Houston 
for both internal and external consumption explaining Enrons role in 
California Most recently May  we received from Peggy Mahoney via Vance 
an EES statement dated  February entitled Media Statement about EES 
Resourcing California Customers It would be helpful if there is a 
comprehensive statement that has recently been put together that we could 
distribute here If not we can put something together here tomorrow and 
email it across to you for approval with the aim of getting something out 
Wednesday

As an aside we had a record  visitors to the EJ website last Friday 
the day the Brattle paper appeared on the website

2001-05-22T09:16:00-07:00,"This is a thorough and helpful analysis  But have we considered the broader 
emergency powers the president might have ie beyond the clean air act 
waivers requested by a governor  It would seem that the importance of the 
defense business in California the large number of military facilities the 
public safety hazards of widespread blackouts etc ought to trigger some 
broader authority

1999-09-10T06:22:00-07:00,"I agree with Marks points  While we have advocated our merger with PGE 
which did not concentrate market power we have intervened in opposition to 
most others  Moreover there is some hope that the German government will 
take the opportunity to use the proposed utility merger to force greater open 
access   We will likely encourage that action and may oppose the merger 
otherwise   Most mergers in this industry are defensive not procompetitive 
and in my view deserve no credit for convergence innovation or 
liberlization

Kean HOU  
Subject Speech to the British Institute of Energy Economists

Margaret  apologies for the delay in getting comments to you on your 
speech  Due to press of other matters I will be brief

First your speech caption refernecing mergers is somewhat different than 
the topic shown in the agenda ie Industry Structure and Competitive 
Behaviour but I trust you are wroking that out with the BIEE  

Second in your first paragraph you note that developments in the energy 
sector over the last decade are due to the mergers of the last five years a 
point I will retrun to later but in any event not entirely consistent in 
terms of timeframes

Third I am surprised that the Enron Corp view is that gas and electricity 
markets grew as they did over the decade due to mergers  In the past things 
like unbundling and nondiscriminatory thirdparty access have featured 
prominently in our advocacy  Indeed though it was not my role at Enron I 
would have thought that in many of the recent electricity mergers predating 
Order No  we would have joined the chorus of voices arguing that these 
mergers concentrated market power and that such market power could only be 
mitigated with the provision of nondiscriminatory thirdparty access an 
argument we will be repeating in eg Germany as noted below  Finally I 
would note that in the past I thought we had questioned the value of mergers 
as an impediment to competitive markets as I recall Ken Rice gave an 
infamous address speech in which he described good mergers and bad 
mergers ie defensive mergers like Houston Industries and NorAm  I 
actually borrowed heavily from that speech two years ago in paris but if we 
have changed our tune that is good to know  Even the good mergers 
identified in his my speech eg Enron Portland have had the goods 
thwarted in part by regulators who would not let us do all we wanted to do 
that was procompetitive  Also in the past we have used as a good example 
of convergence the arbitrage we have done at Sithes facility in NY 
pointing out that we are in an energy or BTUmarket not gas alone or 
electricity alone  Not clear to me that mergers in the US demonstrate this  

Fourth accepting that it is the Enron Corp view that mergers are symbolic 
of the convergence of gas and electricity and are what yield the many 
beneifts of competition that you dsicuss elsewhere in your speech I do of 
course agree with all the platitueds that competition yilds more service 
offerings innovation etc you should be aware coming over to this 
market that a number of mergers are taking place that we have expressed 
concerns about in comments to the regulators and will do so in the future  
here are some you should be aware of  Veical integration in the UK 
electricity industry not clear yet that this will result in better more 
service but definitely loss of counterparties rebundling of business 
before retail unbundling competition has taken hold Exxon Mobil 
consolidation in the upstream sector in Continental Europe which is already 
concentrated VEBA VIAG in Germany probalby okay assuming thridparty 
access is allowed enhanced to the wires  Just FYI any objections we have 
are usually communicated confidentially 

Fifth if you are ging to emphasise mergers as per your title and opening 
paragraph I question the inclusion of all the discussion on privatisation 
which is good but does not seem to demonstrate the benefits of merger 
activity which I read is the premise of your speech per paragraph one  In 
addition recitation of ownership of miles of gathering lines and 
transmission lines does demonstrate change in aggregate ownership but not 
clear it is all due to mergers eg I thin NNG is just capital expansion 
nor does the connection get made that this has lead to innovative or enhanced 
service offerings  I do think excellent points can be made about the 
deregulation divestment of gathering and getting it out of federal 
regualtroy purview but that is not in the speech at this point

Sixth you describe network industries well but in the broader context of 
your speech I think your listeners will assume you are referring to the 
physical network rather than the Enron vision which you capture accurately 
nor is it easily understood how this demonstrates or adds to your point about 
convergence  

Seventh in your table of converged companies you could be asked about the 
fact that Duke has already disposed of the pipeline assets it acquired in the 
PanEnergy deal since sold to CMS apparently keeping only the trading 
business  Also our pieeline assets to do not serve our cogen facilites in 
NJ so not clear to me that thisdemonstrate convergence in the East Coast

Hope this helps  I will be travelling today and Monday but if you have 
questions please leave me voice mails and I will return your calls

PS at p  you describe secular change  I assme that this should read 
sectoral change

Hi Steve 

I wont be able to make the call on Monday

Id be happy to volunteer not to be on the negotiating team  It sounds
like theres no shortage of people who want to be on the committee

My big issue is default service  This industry needs real customers and
the only way to get real customers is to get rid of default service 
Starting with big customers along the lines of the core noncore gas
model is the best way to go  The only way to sell this however is to
get the big customers to agree its a good idea

		 Subject Tariffs Approved

The rate case that the governmental affairs group filed in January on behalf 
of Transredes has come to a very successful conclusion and the new rates 
will go into effect towards the end of this month  The rates are not much 
lower than what we filed for and represent a very significant increase over 
the previous rates  The tariff methodology and revised regulations put into 
effect by the Supreme Decree were followed to the letter by the regulator 
despite political pressure to arbitrarily keep rates down  The deliverables 
here were to  obtain a tariff methodology via Supreme Decree that would 
make the company financeable   rescue it from dire financial straits and  
file a rate case and prosecute it to obtain hard rates in accordance with the 
tariff methodology  This second deliverable has now been completed  
Transredes has had a bond issue pending since last year due to the 
uncertainty about rates it is my understanding that the financial market 
loved the ruling and that Transredes sold  million worth of bonds in about 
 minutes  This ruling should also significantly increase Transredess 
market value relative to Enrons efforts to sell its interest in the company

Subject Tariffs Approved

Gentlemen

I am delighted to report that SIRESE approved substantial increases in TRs 
tariffs consistent with the Law and Regulation  The details are 

     Existing Tariff SIRESE Approved  Increase TR CLHB Proposed TR CLHB  
Increase

Gas Export including surcharges         excluding 
RG  
Liquids Domestic              
Liquids Export               

CLHBs tariffs were also approved as follows           


As you can see we did substantially better than CLHB comparable with our 
liquids domestic 

We will get a detailed report on the assumptions used by SIRESE to reach 
their conclusions on Monday but our inteligence suggests the following 

 Export gas volumes increased to  TR capacity and  GSA  Cuiaba  
assumed for SDA and TEMIN purposes
 RG Compresion project deleted
 Interest rate reduced to  or   ie the rate in our bond issue
 Liquids expansion in the South reduced
 Some continuity of service CAPEX reduced
 Unknown OPEX reduction and maybe a change to the OPEX allocation between 
concesions
 OCC in service date slipped from  to 
 Debt Equity assumption changed from   to  

Our strategy to respond to each of these points is as follows 

 Volumes  Covered by  rule we can blete but can expect little back 
here  Clearly we will appeal if volumes exceed installed capacity in the 
short term ie  
 RG Compression  not worth fighting for since we dont even have the 
support of BG
 Interest Rate  Well get this back when we do a tariff  revision and 
actual rates are used  When we get the detail we will appeal if Jan feels we 
have concrete grounds ie commision costs etc are omited
 Liquids Expansion in the South  Here we intend to do a detailed analysis 
of exactly what has been deleted and as a result what liquids gas production 
will be shut in  If possible all assumptions to be agreed with the affected 
producers PB BG Vintage and Chaco  We will then write to those 
producerscopy SIRESE  VMEH etc stating that on their recommendation the 
project scope was reduced by SIRESE  We will give them an estimate of the 
lost liquids gas production in both volume and cash terms resultant from 
this decision  We will tell them that since they proposed these reductions 
we have no intention of appealing them but invite them to appeal
 Continuity of Service Capex  We need to see the detail here  We will 
take the moral high ground and be absolutely clear that we are not prepared 
to compromise our safety and environmental standards  We need to see exactly 
what has been removed but my thought is that if that means we are unable to 
provide some services eg LPG transportation or the continued operation of 
some liquids laterals we should write to those producers affected suggesting 
that if they wish these services to be continued they need to appeal the 
decision  Again since this is Capex we will get it back in the end on tariff 
revisions as long as the expenditure is approved on an annual basis in the 
SIRESE budget process
 OPEX  need to see the detail on Monday
 OCC  will not appeal  we need to do a detailed study to develop an OCC 
strategy
 Debt Equity ratio  Strictly speaking what has been done is in accordance 
with the Law Regulation  the regulation says the maximum allowed equity is 
  However we have very strong grounds to appeal since  a we are 
currently miles away from   let alone   b we can only borrow for 
CAPEX as per bond issue and the policy of all most banks lending 
institutions with the case presented in the rate case if we borrow to cover 
 of CAPEX we can easily demonstrate that we are still miles away from 
   We intend to fight this one very hard using all the 
external independant help we can get

As you are all aware our big exposure with the rate case was that the much 
needed substantial increase in liquids tariffs would not be approved and we 
would be subjected to some form of arbitary cut  This has not happened 
SIRESE has now approved and hence owns these substantial increases  Having 
got the big hike our job is now to claw back as much as we can from the above 
strategy in the full knowledge that the results of these efforts will be much 
smaller and hence managable increases

Attached is an analysis of the individual impacts on the tariff of the above 
points and the corporate model using the new tariff with our volume 
assumptions ie the worst case

Regards
Doug

Duke Energy Offers Governor Davis Solutions to Californias Power Supply 
Shortfall 

     Committing to Deliver  Megawatts of New Supply to California
               And a FiveYear Fixed Price Supply Contract

    HOUSTON AND MOSS LANDING Calif July   PRNewswire   Duke Energy
North America DENA today offered to California Governor Gray Davis specific
solutions to address the states electricity supply shortage proposing to
deliver  megawatts of new supply through the construction of generation
facilities  In addition DENA proposed a fiveyear fixedprice supply
contract to incumbent utilities to address the immediate concern with volatile
electricity prices
    Californias high electricity prices during peakdemand periods result
from insufficient supply to meet the demand said Jim Donnell president and
chief executive officer of DENA  In the past ten years no significant new
power generation facilities have been built in California  During the same
period peak demand has risen more than  megawatts  This combination
has caused the states reserve margin to fall to less than  percent which
necessarily results in higher prices and abnormal volatility
    Under current procedures it takes in excess of four years to deliver new
power generation in California  To add substantial incremental generating
capacity to California DENA proposed Governor Davis use his existing
authority under the California Emergency Services Act to streamline the
permitting process to facilitate the rapid construction of environmentally
friendly generation by   DENA also asked the governor to use his current
authority to allow California utilities to enter into bilateral contracts with
energy providers so they could better manage their exposure to high energy
prices
    To help solve the states supply shortfall DENA said it remained
committed to adding substantial generation in California  Within two months
and upon receiving final regulatory approvals the company will begin
construction on  megawatts at its Moss Landing facility  The expansion
of the current megawatt facility will be in commercial operation by
summer   And with an expedited permitting process DENA could deploy its
available resources to construct an additional  megawatts for commercial
operation in  and  megawatts for 
    To address the concern associated with the high energy prices experienced
this year DENA offered to provide up to  megawatts of electricity to the
incumbent utilities at  per megawatthour for a fiveyear period beginning
Sept    This would mitigate the exposure to price spikes for a
reasonable time period during which additional generation resources can be
built
    DENA is committed to help bring electricity price stability for the
citizens of California through these proposals Donnell said  We are
confident that our expertise in building and operating power generation
facilities can help resolve the supply crisis
    Duke Energy North America DENA is a leading wholesale energy services

Greetings
In order to keep everyone in the loop the folks on todays call wanted to 
send out a brief summary of the call for the benefit of those who couldnt 
make it  Apologies for any omissions inaccuracies etc  Others who were on 
the call please chime in if Ive gotten anything wrong or missed anything

Best

SUMMARY
Enron Duke El Paso and Williams were on the call as was Michael Hoffman of 
the Blackstone Group the Governors financial advisors
On the subject of how the group would organize itself it was agreed that the 
calls would be open to anyone who wanted to participate
A smaller group consisting of Duke El Paso Enron and Williams would take 
the lead on walking the halls of Sacramento meeting with policy makers and 
advocating whatever plan the group develops
Folks agreed that achieving a comprehensive solution requires a tangible 
process that is the principals need to get in a room face to face for 
however long it takes to work out a resolution
It was agreed that the process should start no later than the beginning of 
next week and that it should take place in Sacramento
It was decided that the Legislature and the Attorney General needed to be 
brought into the process as soon as possible ie next week
There was some discussion regarding the release today of Plan B  Plan B is 
a plan proposed by Democratic and Republican legislators as an alternative to 
the MOU that the Governor struck with Edison  After that call I received a 
copy of Plan B  If youd like a copy please send me your fax number
Folks on the call agreed to have the next supplieronly callin meeting on 
Friday
Finally Michael Hoffman said that they are hoping to have a ratings agency 
level presentation prepared by the end of the week  The goal of the 
presentation is to reassure capital markets that the bonds the state seeks to 
issue are solidly backed by retail rates

The Agenda for Tomorrows Call with the Governors Staff
Item   The Credit Issue
Michael Hoffman said that the Governors office wants to start tomorrows 
meeting discussing the creditworthiness issue  
Hoffman said that the Governors folks are hoping to have completed by the 
start of tomorrows meeting a draft of an agreement between the California 
PUC and CDWR  The agreement is designed to ensure that DWR gets paid for 
power services delivered  
If the draft is ready theyd like to discuss on the call tomorrow  

Item   Identify the Components of a Comprehensive Solution
It was agreed that our group should put on the table at tomorrows meeting 
the universe of issues that need to be included in a comprehensive solution
Enron was asked to take a first stab at what those components are  The 
following is a brief outline which is not intended to be definitive but a 
starting point for discussion
Utility creditworthiness
retail rates must reflect costs
Increase supply
streamline and otherwise reform the siting process
Decrease demand
establish realtime pricing
implement demand buydown and other conservation programs
Create a real market
Remove the State from the powerbuying business as soon as possible eg 
once new rates are in place and utilities are returned to creditworthiness 
approximately  months
Return the procurement role to the utilities
Reinstate Direct Access immediately for all customers
Within  months create a core noncore market structure for 
electricity similar to Californias market structure for natural gas
Keep the industry in the hands of the private sector
Reject proposals calling on the State to take over transmission generation 
etc 
Resolve outstanding legal claims investigations etc
Resolution requires certainty and prompt payment understanding that 
discounts on receivables is on the table for discussion

Steve

Linda will need to talk to you  She has legitimate concerns that Enron 
should not be too eager to help Wyden on this issue as it could be turned 
against us  already the May th Energy Daily article states incorrectly 
that Wyden is mulling a bill that will require energy traders to release more 
market data  I have already flagged for Wydens office that this is not the 
intent of the bill and that if it is used to attack merketers that Enron 
would not support it

Linda suggested that John Shelk and I meet with Wydens office to get his 
commitment that any such amendments will be killed  Are you in Japan

Subject Stock Options

Hi Steve  I know you are extremely busy  but I was just  wondering if you 
found out about whether the  year period apllies to all  options or just the 
ones in that program  Question   does the  year time frame apply to only 
options that are vested at the time of departure or does it apply also to 
options which vest over the  year time frame  I look forward to hearing 
from you  Thank you

"
2001-05-13T13:19:00-07:00,"Several employees have asked about the exercise policy on stock options  
Specifically they want to know what the exercise policy is on i termination 
eg as a result of the prc process ii voluntary departure iii retirement 
or ivresignation and to what extent do the rules vary across plans i 
AESOP LTIP deferred bonus etc  The main focus is on the length of time to 
exercise  I am concerned that there may be some odd incentives in the 
structure  eg are severed employees allowed more time to exercise than 
employees who just leave voluntarily  ie if you want to have a full three 
years to exercise options are you better off becoming a performance issue and 
getting severed than you would be if you simply left the company"

Cindy I chatted with Elyse Elizabeth Labanowski never returned my calls or 
messages on the pt rh issue   Elyse is in favor of having the pt rh 
employees in the regular PRC process with education for managers and at 
facilitator training and a statement in the ground rules to ensure that they 
are not penalized or otherwise disadvantaged by the process  

David and I discussed this option which he is in favor of it as well  In the 
meantime for year end we will be ready with a system change to allow us to 
see pt rh employees on the screen segregated from the full timers and to 
have a live chart of pt rh employees as well as the full timers  We cant do 
that for midyear because it requires a good deal of programming but it is a 
feature we can incorporate at year end  

what do you think

Subject USG overtures on Dabhol

Rebecca
 At a meeting yesterday at OPIC on Trakya another of our problem projects 
Dabhol was raised  A representative from the White House transition team 
joined the conversation  I was asked the terms under which we were prepared 
to negotiate and I told them at a minimum upon a commitment by the Indian 
authorities to serious negotiations which would include full compliance with 
the terms of the contracts and progress in the reform of the MSEB  I made 
clear that we do not see the Godbole Committee as the basis for such a 
discussion
 I think the USG wants to be on record politically encouraging the Indian 
Govt to engage in discussions all parties consider to be meaningful in hopes 
of working things out before it is too late even while through OPIC and EXIM 
it is supporting the move towards PNT  The administration may be concerned 
that without such a diplomatic overture on its part it could be concluded 
that the USG has politically taken a position on the project
 In Trakya for example the USG has been quite proactive in pressing the 
Turkish govt on the payments issue and even in discussing the payment 
concerns with the IMF so that the payments issues for the BOTs two of the 
four in Turkey are US sponsored are taken into account as the IMF program 
moves forward
 So I anticipate that the USG will shortly be meeting with the Indian 
ambassador here and the US Charge in Delhiwill likely be directed to make the 
rounds and meet with senior government officals on the project
 I wanted you to be aware of this also any guidance you can provide would be 
helpful  Thanks John

Subject Barton Bill

You seemed troubled by the call to Barton  This bill may or may not be 
subsumed by the comprehensive energy bill that Congress undertakes this 
summer  Both bills have a very difficult if not nearly impossible path 
ahead given that the Democrats are in no mood for compromise  The call to 
Barton was to  a repair relationships and with the Wall Street Journal 
calling Barton about his troubled past with Enron repair is needed b 
proclaim victory even of a limited nature something I think Enron has not 
done much of c build a further bond with Barton so we would have more 
input at full Committee something we will need given the chances that this 
will go off the track are real and d allow Enron to get significant credit 
for the defeat of price caps  I hear from lots of DC sources that we have 
not had any success in the House Energy and Commerce Committee  Numerous 
folks at the markup noted in private conversations that this was Enrons 
first real role in the Committee  Thus even though this is a very limited 
bill the call made sense  I do not think that this means we should call the 
White House to push the bill with them  The bill itself still has lots of 
obstacles and many potential threats ahead

2001-05-10T02:41:00-07:00,"The presentation looks fine but consider adding this idea in a few slides  
the continuation of a regulated structure poses considerable risk for 
utilities  Californias utilities were pushed to the brink of or into 
bankruptcy because of a regualtory regime which allocated price risk to 
them  All parties are better off in a system where the regulated enterprise 
is limited to natural monopoly functions and all other acitivities are 
conducted in a marketplace

Also did we cover the shortcomings of the Japanese market sufficiently"

Subject Request for Ken to contact Chancellor Reed California State 
University System

Rosalee

I have left Ken a voicemail request but thought I would follow up with a note 
to you that might help clarify the request

As Ken knows Enron Energy Services recently won a STAY by the th Circuit 
Court of an order by a lower court to require us to provide electricity 
service to the UC CSU systems directly versus via using PGE and SCE 
service  The formal court hearing of the appeal is still scheduled for  to 
 days from now  
We would like Ken to phone Charlie Reed Chancellor of CSU  and solicit 
Charlies support for Enron CSU and the UC system to get back together to 
attempt to work out a commercial resolution to these issues  
We believe that sponsorship and support coming from the most senior 
executives offices will help bring the parties together  
Additionally if CSU and UC are interested in working out a settlement we 
would like to solicit their joint request for a delay in the court calendar  
This would allow both teams to focus on a commercial resolution versus 
splitting their focus between a settlement and preparing briefs for the 
appeal appearance  We would like to see a delay request of one month as 
long as the setttlement discussions progress  
A desirable way to kick off settlement discussions would be to ask Ken to 
have lunch with the Head of UC  Charlie Reed of CSU and perhaps one 
business lead in this case this could be me  I am not sure that Kens 
schedule could accomadate that but I thought I would ask  If timing is bad 
for a meeting like this we can find a different alternative    

I will follow up with a phone call to you  Hope this helps

Subject Virginia Manufacturers Association Seminar  June  


Sherry thanks for your guidance concerning the possibility of an Enron
participant for the VMAs Seminar on Electric Utility Restructuring
scheduled for June    I serve as Chairman of the VMAs Energy
Resources Committee which will be responsible for the seminar and the
daylong agenda it will entail

As I explained depending upon the availability of Mr Skilling or another
key individual the VMA  is offering Enron an opportunity to participate in
its seminar in an important way  We seek to have Enron speak on the
subject of the developing competitive market and how that market may be
accessible and beneficial to VMAs member manufacturers which include many
if not most of the large companies residing in Virginia  The purpose of
the seminar is entirely educational as customers in Virginia will be able
under the terms of the Electric Utility Industry Restructuring Act passed
in  to choose their supplier of electricity as early as January 
 and by no later than January    The subject is becoming a high
priority for VMA members given the prominence of energy issues today
generally and the imminence of the date when choice will be available to
Virginia customers

We envision that Enrons message could be encouraging for VMA members who
today hear much about the dilemma in California another seminar
participant will speak on the status of restructuring initiatives in
California and other states and understandably wonder about the prospects
for successful competition and effective choice in Virginia  Enron could
hopefully explain how market benefits might accrue to manufacturers once
the day of choice arrives touching on Enrons online trading platform
aggregation possibilities an alternative which the VMA as an umbrella
organization is considering and related topics

The seminar will begin at am and conclude at pm with the possible
Enron presentation beginning immediately following lunch at pm  We
expect good attendance on the part of VMA members and plan to offer
attendance opportunities to regulatory commission personnel legislators
and others who have been closely involved  with the development of the
Virginia restructuring model as it has evolved over the past five years or
so

I will appreciate hearing from you at your earliest convenience and again
thank you for your assistance  I will be happy to discuss the particulars
with you or anyone else should that be helpful and can be reached at
AEPs state office in Richmond at

Massey and others not to cap the secondary market for example but they need 
to understand the facts before they run off attacking the pipelines

gas utilities in California opposed interstate capacity expansions into the 
state
gas utilities had just as much opportunity as anyone else to participate in 
open seasons for capacity
gas utilities fialed to fill storage
gas utilites have failed to build adequate take away capacity at the Cal 
border
I suspect Socal gas is using its interstate capacity and its in state storage 
to line its own pockets

Subject House and Senate Energy Hearings Today on California Western 
Electric Situation

Steve Ive been thinking about the intense preoccupation with gas prices 
lately and decided to pass this info along because I think its a red flag  
My concern is that there might not only be a backlash affecting our 
interstate pipelines but that our gas marketing efforts might be adversely 
affected  It might well be found that the holders of the firm capacity ie 
marketers and not the pipes themselves are at fault for the large basis 
differentials between the basins and the CA delivery points  Whoever is 
blamed might not really matter  My gut feeling is that the other shoe is 
about to drop with calls for price caps on gas commodity prices into the 
West  This of course could affect years of effort on the gas marketing 
side in establishing competitive markets  Pipeline open access is of no 
avail if there is government intervention in the gas markets  Commissioner 
Massey Senator Feinstein and other Western Senators were saying some very 
concerning things about gas prices the impacts in their states and that 
something needed to be done  FERC responded with an announcement of their 
technical conference on interstate pipeline capacity  and intrastate take 
away capacity which by the way doesnt appear to address storage  
Everyone wants an explanation as to why the basis differential is much higher 
than in other states since they thought it should only consist of transport 
costs  Ray

Subject House and Senate Energy Hearings Today on California Western 
Electric Situation

I was at the Senate hearing today on FERCs market Monitoring and Mitigation 
order and I would add only a few additional and interesting 
regulatoryrelated details to Johns fine summary

The hearing was contentious among the Senators themselves among the FERC 
Commissioners themselves and the interchanges between them

Gas prices were controversial  Commissioner Massey kicked off the discussion 
on this issue citing a transport basis differential into CA of  when it 
was less than a dollar in other areas  He then noted that the high gas cost 
would adversely affect the power price under the auction and that FERC must 
act regarding the high transport differentials We will never get a handle 
on electric prices unless we get a handle on gas prices  That opened the 
floodgates of discussion culminating with the announcement by Commissioner 
Breathitt of FERCs technical conference notice of which issued today on 
the topic of current and projected interstate pipeline capacity and adequacy 
of infrastructure within CA  She said that this would shed light on basis 
differentials and gas prices

Freudian slip  Chairman Hebert was heard to say by various attendees that 
price mitigation in the WSCC would apply at all times in contrast to the 
order which proposes mitigation only during times when reserves reach fall 
below   Whether he misspoke or not remains to be seen  

Regarding the issue of how often mitigation would be invoked in CA ie 
Stages   or 
 Hebert opined Most of the time
 Breathitt said Likely  of the time
 Massey was unconvinced

Several Senators railed at the Commission for not doing its job and 
threatened that if the Commission did not act Congress would act

If you have any questions or need additional detail please feel free to 
call  Ray

Subject House and Senate Energy Hearings Today on California Western 
Electric Situation

I attended both the House and Senate energy committee hearings today  House 
hearing was in the Barton Subcommittee Energy  Air Quality  Senate 
hearing was on last weeks FERC order on a soft price cap and related 
issues  The House witnesses were dominated by California officials Cal 
Energy Commission Cal Air Resources Board Chairman of Gov Davis Generation 
Implementation Task Force  In addition there were witnesses from the 
Western Area Power Admin and Bonneville PA  The Senate witnesses were the 
three FERC commissioners

HIghlights

Chairman Barton said it is still his intention to try to mark up the Barton 
bill HR  next week many on and off the Subcommittee doubt this will 
happen we are gathering political intelligence on those prospects and will 
report back with more information and conclusions once that is done 
Chairman Barton also said he may go to California next week
There was considerable emphasis at both hearings about the alleged role that 
higher natural gas prices into California play in the electric power rate 
increases several witnesses focused on difference in alleged transportation 
costs for similar differences between California and nonCA states FERC at 
the Senate hearing said that today the commission announced a staff technical 
conference for later this month on all aspects of the natural gas market as 
it relates to California a House member from Southern Illinois coal country 
attacked California for using only natural gas in its new power plants
The House witnesses primarily BPA but also the California witnesses 
attacked the negawatt provision in sec  of the Barton bill the criticism 
was that BPA would be forced to purchase power on the open market at a high 
price since it is short sell it to the DSIs under contract let the DSI sell 
it at market rates and capture the difference BPA witness said that thus 
sec  would make it difficult if not impossible to implement their 
strategy to avoid as much as a  percent rate increase on    BPA 
testimony will make it tough for Members of Congress from that service region 
to support sec 
Both hearings also touched on how difficult it would be to actually devise a 
price cap at the House hearing none of those advocating a price cap among 
the witnesses could answer excellent questions about exactly how this could 
be done the witnesses just said cost plus a reasonable profit and said 
leave the details to FERC at afternoon Senate hearing Chairman Hebert had 
the staff bring in  boxes from one FPL case to show how a price cap would 
take too long to bring any relief to California this summer he said last 
weeks soft price cap is much better
Also on the price cap Rep Walden ROR  got the Cal Energy Comm chair to 
admit that if the price caps had been in place earlier California would NOT 
have taken the conservation and new generation steps that it has taken 
recently 
The interplay among the FERC commissioners was much more contentious than it 
was a House hearing on Tuesday although it could have been worse when 
Senate Chairman Murkowski RAK said that help is on the way in the form 
of the nominees for the two vacancies Sen Dorgan DND made a comment that 
suggested that the confirmation process will not be smooth the same concern 
came from the interplay among the Senators which was also somewhat 
contentious at times

Please advise if you have any questions or would like further details

Subject Beta Gamma Sigma

Steve

I am a member of Beta Gamma Sigma BGS the honor society for business 
programs accredited by AASCB  The International Association for Management 
Education  If you are not familiar with BGS a member must be in the upper 
 of their class as a junior and the upper  as a senior and in graduate 
school to be nominated for induction into the society

In an effort to provide additional programs and benefits to alumni members 
alumni chapters are being developed around the country  There are currently 
nine alumni chapters around the US with a new one being formed in the 
Houston area  I am serving on a steering committee for the development of 
this Houston Area Alumni Chapter  Our primary reasons for starting a Houston 
Area Chapter include networking professional affiliations outreach to 
students resources learning opportunities and providing scholarships

Our initial outreach to Beta Gamma Sigma members will be through a 
reception dinner to be held in October   We are currently looking at 
either October  or   All  Houston area members will be invited to 
participate however we expect attendance to be closer to  people  
The ages experiences and business affiliation of the members will be very 
diverse but all will have the common thread of business excellence

The details of this event are still being finalized however at our last 
meeting the discussion encompassed possible speakers and topics  
Overwhelmingly the team decided on Electricity Deregulation in Texas and 
since I work at Enron I was asked to assist in locating a dynamic speaker  
Cliff Baxter suggested that you would be an ideal speaker on this topic  Are 
you available and willing to address this group in October  

If I can provide any additional information please let me know

Subject Enron Advertising


Mark 

Thanks for the call a couple of weeks ago regarding our new ad campaign  The 
challenge as I understand it is that we have difficulty in quantifying the 
benefit and effectiveness of our ads   We can measure on a periodic basis 
what the CEO CCO CFO perception of Enron is on a periodic basis but this does 
not break down the impact of our PR efforts from an ad campaign   I 
understand this dilemma

But one thing that we could measure that is quite important to me is what our 
employees think about these ads    If all else fails these ads should make 
our employees proud to work for Enron  and this is something we should be 
able to measure on a consistent basis

I know you have an upcoming event in California where your organisation will 
talk about problems and challenges we have  so if you could consider this 
idea I would be very appreciative  And of course dont get to hooked on 
Gods country while you are in Napa

Thanks

2001-05-06T08:30:00-07:00,"I think the meeting is on Wednesday but if you can be there Sacremento I 
expect you should  As I mentioned in my voicemail I think the meeting will 
not be particularly substantive  more likely it is a photo op for the 
governor to show how tough he is on the pirate generators  Based on your 
message below should we still plan to send somebody  I still think we 
should if we can manage the legal risk

Mike  would you be able to attend as well

Williams Reliant Enron Duke AES Dynegy Mirant and Sempra have been
invited to a meeting with the Governor  The press release provides The
agenda will include unpaid debts credit and the supply of power
Williams is concerned about attending such a meeting of competitors without
the presence of antitrust counsel even under the sponsorship of the Governor
who presumably acts as both the sovereign and on behalf of the buyers
We are looking into the Sovereign immunity and NoerrPennington issues to
determine how best to protect any such group discussions from challenge or
as evidence in any of the pending cases  Are any of your clients also
concerned about this and are you also looking into these issues
Williams would like to have a joint defense protected conference call
perhaps later today if possible to discuss this meeting and consider
whether antitrust counsel is needed for the group or if each participant
should attend with its own counsel  Please let me have your thoughts and
whether one of you or other counsel is interested and available to
participate in a conference call  Thanks

		 Subject Hendricks


The complaintalbeit brief filed May  in San Diego Superior Court by 
Strategy Integration Inc versus Michael Aguirre and the other Hendricks  
plaintiffs attorneys is quite extraordinary in its disclosure A hard copy 
is being faxed The expert firm alleges they were retainedto explain 
research and investigate potential claims of gaming and collusion by energy 
providers who supply electricity to the California Energy Market and 
retained to perform utility and energy consulting services After 
alleging that the Hendricks attorneys refused to pay Plaintiffs first 
billing  it is alleged thatdefendants refusal may have resulted from the 
conclusions Plaintiff drew in its analysis We should consider if there is 
there a way to get this filing to Senator Dunns office or a more friendly 
Senator  without identifying us as the sourceThey can see what some expert 
in the field  hired by the plaintiffs  class action lawyers apparently 
concluded on their own about the claims of gaming and collusion I suspect 
that  Sen Dunn has no interest but some Republican Senator might have some 
use for it It could  have some value if the hearings go forward This is not 
urgent timewise but I wanted to bring it to your attention

we discussed last week  We can communicate changes by email or Ill be 
happy to arrange a short conference call  If possible I would like to 
distribute this by Wednesday or Thursday of this week  After the four of us 
reach consensus I suggest we preview Cindy and maybe the HR heads prior to 
distributing  

You will note that based on conversations I had with Skilling last week 
where he emphasized his desire that we have one program rather than a 
fractured program by business unit I have added a review of the business 
unit distributions to the final meeting where we discuss the top perfomers  
Ive also added Janet Dietrich tent and another EES person tbd to the AA 
Committee since they have a large group of AAs and no representation on the 
committee  

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments and thanks for your 
help  Ted and Terry did all the hard work

Regards

Subject my work situation

Dear Steve Jim and Rick
I just wanted to give you a quick update on my situation at Rice and to
inquire as to a future project with your group at Enron

First I apologize for my prolonged recent absences I have had two
longstanding academic projects one was due   it was on final review
 a paper about corporate political strategy  and just was accepted for
publication at our top academic journal and another is due   The  
paper was commissioned long ago but is a key paper in a June conference
topic is methods to study corporate political activities and the public
affairs function In order to get it done properly I need to forego any
work at Enron until later in the month

A project of interest to me at Enron  and I hope one that you also have
interest  is assessing the effectiveness of governmental affairs John
told me that he conducted such a study for the group last year One of the
methodological challenges is to calculate the benefits that government
affairs brings  especially in a system where for example on the
legislative side much of the work of government affairs is to block
legislation at very early stages I suspect that govt affairs needs to
justify its existence for internal budgets at Enron and thus the benefits
of the function are important to quantify Id like to review any of the
previous work and make suggestions as necessary

At some point let me know how you would like to proceed

Otherwise I hope all is well with you all

Cordially

Doug

 It is critical to our nations energy future  to achieve robust competition 
in wholesale power markets in order to ensure that electricity can move most  
effectively from where it is produced to where it is most needed To that 
end this Administration will strongly encourage the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission FERC  to actively exercise jurisdiction over all 
aspects of electricity transmission in interstate commerce and place all uses 
of the grid under the same rates terms and conditions  This jurisdiction 
must also be extended by Congress to cover nonFERC jurisdictional power

Subject Entry tax to dergulating markets



The Forbes April   editorial piece Slow Starters on page  discusses
the entry tax which is the capital burden for starting a new business  It 
states that rich countries
on average have relatively low entry costs while poor countries have 
stagering entry costs caused
by corruption endless beuacracy and cost of delays  These entry hurdles 
and asscoiated costs
do not produce any tangible benefits for consumers workers or the 
environment

We might want to make the analogy of entry tax for new deregulated gas  
power markets  Things like
negotiated thirdparty access rather than regulated TPA substantially slow 
the speed of new entrants and hence deter competition
Negotiated TPA creates uncertainty for new entrants they never know what 
they are going to get and clearly slows
the new comers down

I will send you a copy of the Forbes piece

Allheres some thoughts on the RGA related events  We currently have Ken 
scheduled to participate in an energy roundtable discussion on the afternoon 
of the nd with at least four governors attending that sessionKempthorne 
Hull Geringer and Ridge  Engler and Rowland are also attending the overall 
event but they will be in a healthcare breakout session  Kaufman and I 
thought that it would be particularly helpful for Arizona Gov Hull and Idaho 
Gov Kempthorne to hear Kens remarks and have a chance to talk with him  

I have also been working with Rosalee to schedule an early evening 
pm meeting that night  with Exelon co CEO John Rowe John Rowe 
will be in California for some investor meetings and well as attending some 
sections of the RGA events  I have told my counterpart at Rowes office that 
we would confirm Kens availability on Monday morning

If you do decide that Ken should attend the Davis meeting in Sacremento that 
day instead we will just reconfigure a bit  Paul and I will cover the RGA 
events and I will cancel the John Rowe get together I would also want to 
talk about having Mr Lay reach out to Hull and Kempthorne via phone sometime

ON THE EXERCISE OF MARKET POWER THROUGH
STRATEGIC WITHHOLDING IN CALIFORNIA
Scott Harvey and William W Hogan
April  

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Beginning in June of  the shock of unexpectedly high prices in the 
California electricity market convinced everyone of the need for policies to 
correct the apparent market failures The public debate and policy 
discussions have been dominated by a focus on market power as a principal 
problem amenable to regulatory solution However design of effective 
policies to moderate prices or mitigate their effects depends on the 
diagnosis of the underlying causes High prices attributable largely to an 
exercise of market power in electric generation would point to particular 
market participants and behaviors that could be targeted for regulatory 
action By contrast high prices attributable to bad electricity market 
design would indicate a need for changes in the design High prices 
attributable to higher fuel prices environmental constraints and capacity 
shortages on the other hand would prompt actions to address the cost of 
fuel and environmental limitations and indicate that retail loads should 
receive the appropriate price signal for conservation

Suppliers could affect market prices by strategically withholding some 
capacity in order to profit on the capacity actually sold in the market But 
charging high prices during periods of scarcity is not classified as 
exercising market power if there is no strategic withholding of supply 
Likewise refusing to supply without being paid is not an exercise of market 
power Although the potential for withholding exists for many suppliers the 
focus of attention has been on the exercise of market power by thermal 
generators in California

On its face the experience of extremely high prices suggests that the 
exercise of market power could be important But at the same time the data 
show that there have been profound changes in the California market such that 
the thermal generators have actually increased their production more than 
demand has grown If anything thermal generators that hit annual output 
limits produced too much rather than too little in the summer of  
Furthermore the widespread impacts of higher electricity prices throughout 
the western market both on and off peak indicate that if the exercise of 
market power is important it is occurring to an extent and through channels 
unprecedented in this or other electricity markets In short this is a 
complicated story and there is ample room for further investigation of the 
data and diagnosis of causes

Examination of the major analyses of the exercise of market power reveals 
that the estimated magnitude of the possible strategic withholding of 
electric generation is small enough to make it important to verify the 
simplifying assumptions If strategic withholding were large and pervasive 
then the real details of the California electricity market could be ignored 
But it is by now apparent that the evidence is not clear and any finding of 
the presence or absence of strategic withholding of generation in the 
California electricity market could turn on the simplifying assumptions used 
in the analysis of the data For example annual limits on production 
dictate that plants should not run in many hours when prices are higher than 
direct incremental costs hence examinations of output decisions for 
individual hours or months are necessarily incomplete The variation in real 
time conditions is large enough to produce significant reductions in output 
compared to the expectations given dayahead prices hence with capacity 
constraints average optimal production is necessarily less than optimal 
production at average prices Limits on the ramping rate of generation 
units startup costs minimum load costs and other operational 
inflexibilities imply that a dispatch day is not just twentyfour separate 
hours and must be analyzed chronologically recognizing these factors And 
so on Accounting for such effects can reverse the implications of the 
previous evidence Unfortunately the real details are neither simple nor 
incidental

It is difficult to conduct a study of market power based solely on publicly 
available data A fuller analysis would require data available only to the 
California Independent System Operator and has not been done Many factors 
contributed to higher electricity prices in California and the market power 
theme is only at most part of the story The import of the previous 
analyses is not to prove that market power has been exercised in the 
California electricity market but rather to suggest that it might be 
important The import of the sensitivity analysis here is not to prove that 
market power has not been exercised in the electricity market but rather 
to suggest that it is unlikely to be the dominant factor and may not even be 
significant With the available data in the public domain and the special 
complications introduced by the California market design the margin of error 
in estimating the extent of the possible exercise of market power through 
strategic withholding of electric generation is of the same order of 
magnitude as the effect being measured On balance to date the publicly 
available data provides no reason for the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission to change its conclusion that there is no evidence of strategic 
withholding nor any proof that no strategic withholding has occurred

By contrast there is general agreement that the California electricity 
market design is seriously flawed Furthermore there is evidence that the 
policy responses that have been adopted in California have accelerated an 
already serious market collapse Hence without dismissing the possibility 
of the exercise of market power the principal policy focus should be on 
fashioning workable solutions for the other more serious problems in market 
design that relate to the underlying causes of the market meltdown

Separate from market power mitigation California should pay its bills raise 
incremental prices to retail customers and move as quickly as possible to 
operating a coordinated and efficient market with consistent pricing for all 
that includes unit commitment dayahead scheduling and realtime 
balancing Although not a panacea these steps would address immediate 
problems and set the stage for longerterm initiatives to expand generation 
capacity transmission infrastructure and the reach of an efficient market 
to the western interconnected grid

Subject Some Background on California Gas Price SpikesThe Other Side of 
the Story

Last week I distributed a presentation that the Brattle Group gave before 
the California Inquisition ie legislative gas oversight committee looking 
into the gas price spikes at the Cal border  

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up 
on SoCalGas recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned 
power plants  Edison arranged for the Brattle Group to be the star 
witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing  Their job was to set up El Paso and 
Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day  Their 
message was simple and simplistic

El Paso and Dynegy have market power
They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas 
at the border to obscene levels
That in turn has driven up electricity prices

Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow and Rob Bradley asked that I provide 
the alternative view to the Edison Brattle rant in the event that he gets 
any questions on the topic  Its attached  Apologies its quick and dirty 
but it provides the basics

Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy but might be useful to 
offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California 
Legislature is peddling

Finally we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing the 
California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis 
when ENA controlled a portion of  the capacity but the overriding goal of 
the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy

Subject FERCs Prospective Mitigation and Monitoring Plan for CA Wholesale 
Electric Markets

The following report is comprised of what was discussed at the Commission 
meeting held tonight at approximately  PM EST and additional intelligence 
gathered from FERC staffers after the meeting by Joe Hartsoe

Physical Withholding  To prevent physical withholding the plan will 
require sellers with PGAs to offer all their available power in real time  
All California generators even those not subject to FERC price regulation 
will be required to sell into the ISOs real time market as a condition of 
their use of the ISOs interstate transmission lines Hydroelectric 
facilities will be exempted  for yr 

Price Mitigation   The plan will establish a single market clearing price 
auction for the real time market  During Stage   and  emergencies in the 
ISOs real time market each generator other than hydro with a 
participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power 
and bid its marginal cost based on the generators heat curve emission 
rates gas costs and emission costs plus  for OM  The gas cost will be 
the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California 
emissions are to be based on Cammon Fitzgerald  The gas cost and 
emissions will be published the day after for use on the following day  A 
single market clearing price is determined in real time for all generators  
Highest bid sets the clearing price  Each gas fired generator must file with 
FERC and the ISO on a confidential basis heat and emission rates for each 
generating unit  The ISO will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost 
for each generator including maintenance and operating costs  In the event 
a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price the generator must 
within  days of the end of each month file a report with FERC and the ISO 
justifying its price  FERC has  days to review act  No opportunity costs 
in real time  Marketers are in the same boat as they must be prepared to 
justify bid at purchased cost based on specific purchases or portfolio with 
no opportunity cost  However credit sleeves are permissible

Demand Response  Beginning June  only public utility load serving entities 
must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be 
curtailed under those bids  FERC is attempting to break the demand curve  
  

Outages  PGA generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced 
outages in accordance with the Commission Staff proposal adopted by FERC 

Term  Order expires one year from date of issuance

RTO Filing  California ISO and two Utilities must make RTO filing by June  
or Order lapses with no further effect

ISO Reporting  On September   ISO must file a status report on how 
things are working and how much generation has been built  Comments are due 
in  days  Quarterly reports thereafter

Revocation of Market Based Rate Authority and Refunds  The market based rate 
authority of all public utilities is conditioned on  no physical withhold 
of capacity and  no inappropriate bidding behavior  Inappropriate bidding 
behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the 
generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit 
behavior  An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be 
inappropriate  In addition hockey stick bids are expressly prohibited 
ie  bidding  at marginal cost and  at a much higher level

Limited  filing  Applies to sales in the WSCC outside California  
Refund conditions apply in real time spot markets when contingency within a 
control area falls below   Control areas are not required to publish when 
this condition occurs  Apparently anything over marginal cost must be 
justified  All marketers and nonhydroelectric generators must offer to sell 
contractually and physically available capacity energy to a location within 
WSCC  FERC is attempting to mirror the rules applied in California  
Comments are due in  days on the  investigations  The refund effective 
date is  days from publication of the Order

Nox Limits in California   Must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is 
prohibited from running by law  However it appears that incurring fines 
does not overcome the must sell requirement just include the fines as part 
of the price bid  Also if Nox is limited may seek to show that generation 
would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price  

Surcharge to pay past amount due  Comments are due in  days on  whether 
FERC should require the ISO to surcharge parties for payment into an escrow 
account to pay past costs and  the effect this surcharge would have on the 
PGE bankruptcy filing  

No mention was made at the meeting as to issue of exports of power from 
California  The Order is not finally drafted as of yet and the status of 
the foregoing items could change upon issuance of the Final Order  We will 
keep you posted

Subject Some Background on California Gas Price SpikesThe Other Side of 
the Story

Last week I distributed a presentation that the Brattle Group gave before 
the California Inquisition ie legislative gas oversight committee looking 
into the gas price spikes at the Cal border  

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up 
on SoCalGas recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned 
power plants  Edison arranged for the Brattle Group to be the star 
witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing  Their job was to set up El Paso and 
Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day  Their 
message was simple and simplistic

El Paso and Dynegy have market power
They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas 
at the border to obscene levels
That in turn has driven up electricity prices

Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow and Rob Bradley asked that I provide 
the alternative view to the Edison Brattle rant in the event that he gets 
any questions on the topic  Its attached  Apologies its quick and dirty 
but it provides the basics

Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy but might be useful to 
offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California 
Legislature is peddling

Finally we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing the 
California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis 
when ENA controlled a portion of  the capacity but the overriding goal of 
the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy

Best
Jeff

Subject Request for contribution

Dear Mr Metts

Enron being one of the extraordinary companies that has been able to
restructure the corporation in an effective way and that still is under
important business transformation is a subject of many interests The
current challenges are keeping companys management busy Being aware of
this I wanted to take liberty of asking if it would be possible to get
someone of Enrons top executive to contribute Nokias top executive
development program We have invited a few external key note speakers to
elaborate their companys transformation This kind of experience change has
proved to be beneficial for both parties Also Nokias experiences have been
valuable input in certain restructuring processes

This program called Panorama is an annual top executive development
program which takes about half a year in three modules In every year we
have nominated  participants to this intensive action The program target
is three folded give input to companys strategy development strengthen
and integrate common understanding of companys direction and develop
leadership capacity The program owner is Jorma Ollila CEO of Nokia

What are benefits from Enrons point of view in the case we are able to get
someone of Enrons executives in the program I think that one of the most
important outcome of this kind of events is  to open a dynamic networking
and discussion forum between our executives Both parties could capitalize
this cooperation

In short we would appreciate very much if we could have your companys
presentation in this Panorama forum

Looking forward to hearing from you

Yours sincerely

Subject Draft Organizational Announcement about Japan


May I please have your comments if any on this draft by close of business 
Wednesday  We hope to have agreed on the QAs by then and to send it out 
the announcement on Thursday

John

To be sent to  All Enron Europe all employees in Japan  all Global Markets 
and all VPs and up around the company

Enron has established several wholesale businesses in Japan in the last year 
including Metals  Power Plant Development via our investment in EnCom  
Coal  LNG  Weather   We see significant opportunities in each of these 
businesses and we will continue to expand our presence in Japan in order to 
capture these opportunities  However while Japan continues to make progress 
towards a liberalized electricity market significant barriers to power 
trading remain under the current interim market structure  Until further 
tangible steps are taken to improve third party access for electricity in 
Japan we will suspend our power marketing efforts and focus on the 
significant opportunities that currently exist in our other wholesale 
businesses Any statement regarding our existing power sales commitment  
Once the necessary regulatory changes have been completed we expect to 
aggressively pursue Enrons traditional position as the leading buyer and 
seller of electricity in every deregulated market  

We are making a number of organization changes in order to better align our 
resources with the opportunities in the Japanese market  deleted text Joe 
Hirl our President of Enron Japan will move to the Global Markets group and 
lead a team that will focus on developing all our Global Markets 
opportunities in Japan especially Weather  Oil  LNG  Coal and 
Shipping    We expect to continue our general recruiting  of Japanese 
nationals and as President of Enron Japan  Joe will continue to provide the 
overall business leadership to both recruiting and the Analyst and Associate 
program in Japan  The Finance origination team headed by Jeremy Thirsk will 
continue to report to Joe and also move to Global Markets  Our power trading 
group led by Morton Erik Pettersen will transition into other roles around 
Enron  The Equity FX Interest rate team which is a part of Global Markets 
has two employees in the Tokyo office today and they expect to expand their 
efforts throughout the year

The EnCom group which is our power plant development business with minority 
partners and headed by Carey Sloan will continue its efforts in developing 
power plants in Japan  We are pleased with the progress we are making on a 
number of sites and EnCom will continue to report to the Enron Europe Office 
of the Chairman

Our Metals team headed by Kazunari Sugimoto will continue to report through 
Enron Metals in London

By May we expect Enron Credit to have two to three employees in Tokyo pursing 
the Credit Derivative business  These employees remain in  Enron Credit  a 
part of Enron Europe

EBS has two employees headed by Jim Weisser and this team expects to expand  
by year end

The Industrial Markets team also expects to have two employees in the Tokyo 
office in the next couple of months

In the last seven months the commercial support services for Japan have been 
transitioned to London for support and this is not changing  Jane McBride 
heads the legal team and will continue to functionally report  to Mark Evans 
General Counsel in London   The RAC function will continue to report to Ted 
Murphy head of RAC for Enron Europe   The Risk Management and Accounting 
team is headed by JanErland Bekeng will continue to functionally report to 
Fernley Dyson in London  The  IT HR  Tax and real estate teams will also 
continue to functionally report to London 

Nick ODay who heads the Public Affairs group Government  Regulatory 
Affairs and the Public Relations in Japan will report to the Enron Europe 
Office of the Chair with a Public Relations functional reporting to Jackie 
Gentle in London and a Government Affairs functional reporting to Rick 
Shapiro in Houston   We anticipate that his teams efforts will be primarily 
directed to supporting the EnCom power plant development team but they will 
also continue to provide support for Global Markets EBS  Industrial Markets

We have already made considerable progress in breaking into the Japanese 
markets across a wide range of Enron businesses and we anticipate that this 
will provide significant profit growth for years to come Through these 
current changes we can demonstrate our ability to be flexible and target our 
resources where they will realise the most immediate value for the company

What are your thoughts  I recommend talking with Steve Kean and Joe Hartsoe 
ASAP to coordinate with the ESCA OATI Perot System consortium regarding the 
Midwest ISO  Dick George from ESCA mentioned that Ross Perot would like to 
make contact at a high level inside Enron to discuss the merits of Enron 
supporting a forprofit transco structure for the Midwest ISO  The 
ESCA OATI Perot System consortium is offering a system to the Midwest ISO 
that is designed to support  a forprofit transco  The consortiums primary 
competitor ABB has a system that supports the more structured ISO 
environment similar to California and PJM

Kevin and Lloyd

The Signatories of the Midwest ISO follow
Allegheny Power
Ameren formerly Union Electric and Central Illinois Public Service Company
CILCO
Cinergy
Commonwealth Edison
Hoosier Energy Rural Electric Cooperative
Illinois Power
Kentucky Utilities
Louisville Gas  Electric
Northern States Power
Wabash Valley Power
Wisconsin Electric

The status of the formation is antiprofit ie a holding pattern is in
place with a FERC Tariff request to carry over seven years  The view is
that a forprofitISO goes completely against the grain and that only a
mandate by FERC will get them to change  Given Entergys fight with FERC
even a mandate will be a hard fought court exercise

At present there are sixteen control areas therefore the system requirement
with grandfathered contracts in each is odious

Nevertheless the form ESCA and our partners Perot OATI and Tenfold offer
is a fullup system ready for a forprofit implementation  As you might
expect the division of responsibilities on the proposal is Perot as Program
Manager their position with the California ISO again OATI for Tagging and
Congestion Management Tenfold for Settlement and Billing and finally ESCA
for the EMS Market Systems  We prefer a forprofit model as it betters our
offering and provides more nearterm opportunity

Discussions with the Perot OATI and Tenfold partners concurred that sharing
information with Enron and viceversa would help all of us understand how
each side may be able to position ourselves with the Midwest ISO  Mutual
help and cooperation is to our partners ESCAs and it would seem Enrons
advantage

We are so glad to have Enron as a Cornerstone Member and look forward to 
working with you as one of our Advisory Board members
As Gary mentioned we are having our Houston ePanel on Thursday May   
Thanks so much for working on getting us the right person from Enron to be a 
panelist  The details of the event are as follows

 ePanel
eEnergy  Evolving Trends in the Deregulation of the Electric Industry
The US electric industry is undergoing a sea change in the way it delivers 
electricity to millions of households and businesses nationwide The  
billion industry which has been called the last great governmentsanctioned 
monopoly is slowly but surely being deregulated and opened to competition 
giving consumers the power to choose their electricity provider in much the 
same way they choose telephone carriers
Deregulation now scheduled to occur on January   is coming to Texas 
and with it comes the power of choice for most Texans Just like you can 
choose your phone or cable provider you will soon be able to choose your 
electric provider 
Panelists include
Waters Davis President Reliant Energy Retail Services
Brett Perlman Commissioner Public Utilities Commission of Texas
Time
   Private reception  panelists Texas eComm Members and media
   CheckIn
   ePanel Discussion
           Networking

Also We were planning on hosting this event at Dynegy however they are 
unable to accommodate our request due to scheduling conflicts that were 
unforseen  We were hoping that Enron would consider hosting the event and 
allow us to use your auditorium in light of this new development  Please let 
me know if this is a possibility  Thanks for your consideration

Subject DRAFT response to Greenpeace Kyoto letter

Attached is a first draft of a response to Greenpeaces April  letter to 
Jeff Skilling asking for Enrons answers to some specific questions on the 
Kyoto Protocol and climate change   Similar letters were delivered by 
Greenpeace Europe in native languages to Enrons offices in the UK 
Netherlands Spain and Belgium

I have attached a copy of one of the letters below  All the questions are 
the same in each

I have drafted a response with the goals of

  Being responsive to Greenpeace without being defensive or without 
greenwashing   We have an alreadypublished public statement on climate 
change and a very positive solutionoriented story to tell with many facts 
and accomplishments to back up our statements   I think our letter can land 
in the stack that they consider positive responses and not in the stack of 
nonresponses or we dont care responses

  Steering away from directly answering the nowin questions about Kyoto 
  I think we can respond to the letter in a way that provides meaningful 
answers to the general themes of the letter   I have discussed this with 
many of you already but I strongly feel that we should not get dragged down 
into debates over what we like dislike support oppose about Kyotowell 
quickly get into questions we cant now answer and may never be able to 
answer   Id prefer it if we rise above the politics of the issue and look 
solutionoriented by saying counties and companies should continue to be 
engaged in this important issue

  Developing corporatewide messages that we can use in multiple 
applications  arming our PR and govt affairs advocates with a tight script 
to use in their efforts responding to shareholder inquiries and annual 
meeting QA  Ken Lay or other executive speeches and presentations 
something for our Corporate Responsibility annual report  

Sorry for the long preamble but climate change has become a very sensitive 
issue of late and our message strategy needs to be very coordinated and we 
need to have one clear set of statements that everyone in the company can 
understand and use  With that said I also believe that these messages 
should be used very carefully as the subject matter is complex and straying 
too far from the basics can be dangerous  We should designate one or two 
clear spokespeople that can answer any follow up to the Greenpeace letter by 
press or policymakers and really stick to the boundaries of whats in our 
response letter

There is also the issue of customizing responses from the European offices 
using this letter as a template and adding a few examples of Enron good deeds 
in the local areas   I am not opposed to doing so but would again 
appreciate being able to review these responses before they go  Please let 
me know if you have other views

I would like to send our response by early next week maybe even Monday   
if we can turn it around that fast  Thank you for your input and assistance 
and I look forward to your reply

Jeff

State might balk on power But refusing to pay ridiculous prices could add 
to crisis
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
Published April   
Adding to the risk of summertime blackouts the state water department said 
Thursday it might not pay ridiculous prices for electricity even if that 
leaves California short of power 
The Department of Water Resources which has been buying electricity for the 
states two beleaguered utilities since midJanuary wouldnt spell out what 
it considers ridiculous But if prices get too high the state might be 
better off ordering blackouts or implementing proposed new conservation 
programs designed at cutting usage on short notice said Raymond Hart the 
departments deputy director in charge of power purchases 
Gov Gray Davis took a different view saying We will continue to keep the 
lights on When youre fighting a forest fire you dont say Let me see 
how much is this going to cost me Maybe I cant write the check maybe I 
cant put the fire out You put the fire out and then worry about the cost 
later 
But Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the Governors Office indeed is 
contemplating whether to refuse to buy power at any cost At what point does 
the state say Enough is enough Those scenarios are certainly under 
discussion Maviglio said 
The water department until recently resisted buying all the power Southern 
California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co needed refusing to 
purchase electricity it deemed too costly But lately its had to relax that 
stance because of an order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Hart 
said 
That April  order said power generators can no longer be forced to sell 
electricity to uncreditworthy entities such as the Independent System 
Operator which manages the states power grid Because the ISO  which gets 
its money from the utilities  can no longer buy the power the water 
department is now buying all the electricity required by the utilities Hart 
said But he said the department could back off if prices get out of hand 
If the prices just get ridiculous altogether theres a policy call to be 
made and well cross that bridge when we get there Hart said 
The ISO has predicted that severe shortages could bring  days of rolling 
blackouts this summer The potential refusal of the water department to buy 
ultraexpensive power could further strain the grid 
On a daily basis were dealt a set of cards said ISO spokesman Patrick 
Dorinson It sounds like  were going to be handed another set of cards 
and were going to have to try to maintain the reliability of the grid as 
best we can 
Harts comments came amid an increasingly rancorous debate between Davis and 
PGE over the water departments power expenditures State spending shot up 
following PGEs April  filing for bankruptcy protection 
Davis said generators began demanding a credit penalty from the water 
department because of the PGE bankruptcy proceedings As a result the 
states daily costs shot up last week to  million from  million in 
the week before PGE went bankrupt the governors office said 
Hart agreed saying several generators raised their prices Every time 
theres a major hiccup in the market such as PGE bankruptcy or a staged 
alert by the ISO theres a price runup Hart said 
But prices have settled down this week After peaking at  a megawatt hour 
April  prices for north state power were at  on Thursday just below 
what they were prior to the bankruptcy filing according to the Enerfax news 
service 
PGE however said its bankruptcy filing had nothing to do with the states 
increased spending 
This claim is simply not accurate the utility said in a memo to reporters 
Rather the increased spending is due solely to the fact that the water 
department is buying more units of electricity in the wake of the FERC order 
PGE said 
Regardless of the cause the increased spending by the water department could 
further strain the states budget  and complicate Davis plan to finance 
the power purchases through a bond offering 
The state has committed  billion from its general fund for power 
purchases since January Those mounting purchases along with PGEs 
bankruptcy filing and other energy crisis uncertainties prompted a third 
Wall Street credit rating agency Fitch to place the state on a ratings 
watch this week meaning the rating might be downgraded 
A downgrade could raise Californias borrowing costs All three of the 
leading Wall Street credit agencies now have California on a ratings watch 
Meanwhile the state Public Utilities Commission on Thursday ordered an 
investigation of why hundreds of cogenerators and other alternative energy 
providers havent resumed production even though theyve begun receiving 
payments again from Edison and PGE 
These generators under contract to the utilities provide more than  
percent of the states energy supply Hundreds shut down worsening 
Californias power situation because theyd received little or no money from 
the utilities since November 
The PUC ordered Edison and PGE to resume payments starting this week for 
new power deliveries 
But the generators say the payments arent enough to get them back online 
So PUC President Loretta Lynch said the commission will investigate whether 
to order Edison and PGE to begin repaying them the hundreds of millions owed 
for past deliveries

SMUD directors vote to hike rates A tentative increase of  to  is 
blamed on rising energy costs
By Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writer
Published April   
Ten years of stable electricity bills vanished in a single unanimous vote 
Thursday night as directors of Sacramento Municipal Utility District gave 
tentative approval to rate hikes ranging from  percent to  percent 
The new rates will go into effect immediately after a final vote scheduled 
for May  
This is quite alarming to all of us said director Peter Keat But praising 
the value of a communityowned electric company that provides everything 
from shade trees to public votes on rates Keat said he saw no choice 
SMUD which once hoped to lower electric bills this year or next as 
deregulation took hold was caught up in the spiraling wholesale costs that 
helped send Pacific Gas and Electric Co into bankruptcy proceedings 
The price of natural gas which fuels SMUDs cogeneration plants has risen 
steeply 
Wholesale electricity which SMUD buys to supplement power produced by its 
own plants nearly tripled between October and January 
And the weather has been dismal Rainfall and snowmelt that feed SMUDs 
hydroelectric plants on the upper American River are about  percent of 
normal to date 
But during a twohour hearing a small contingent of consumers asked the 
board to reconsider 
I realize that rates have to go up but this seems like a big percentage all 
at once said Marian Ender 
Several criticized a  percent surcharge that until only a few days before 
had been proposed at  percent Among them was Duy Tu an engineering manager 
at Intel who served on SMUDs advisory rate committee 
The increase cannot come at a worse time for Intel he said although he 
understands the need for it He urged the board to act now to make more 
electricity available in the future 
We are way too dependent on some external force to keep the lights on Tu 
said 
Overall a base rate increase averaging  percent will raise about  
million annually for SMUD and a special 
 percent surcharge will raise about  million in its first year Most of 
the surcharge scheduled to drop to  percent annually for two subsequent 
years will go into an emergency fund 
We have to build back our savings account Its been gutted said director 
Susan Patterson 
The rate increases will fall most heavily on small commercial and large 
industrial power users although households with very low electricity bills 
will feel a sharp bite from the addition of a  monthly service fee 
The flat fee adds less than  percent to what was a typical residential 
SMUD bill of  but its a  percent rate hike for someone whose monthly 
bill hovers around  
I just dont think that part is right Ender said We should only pay for 
usage 
Tom Reavey took the board to task for unfair and unequitable rates that 
charge agriculture and small businesses less than what they cost SMUD to 
serve while charging homeowners and renters slightly more 
But board members defended going easier on rates for the pumps that run 
farmers wells and irrigation systems 
We all gain great benefits from living in a community that has nearby 
agriculture Keat said 
The new rates will apply throughout SMUDs service territory which includes 
a narrow slice of southern Placer County and all but the southwestern tip of 
Sacramento County They will not 
affect people who receive electric service from PGE which last month was 
granted a  percent hike by state regulators 
If you want to see a bunch of folks who are really facing some stark times 
its PGE customers said board member Howard Posner 
While there is widespread speculation that PGEs rate hikes are the first of 
many Posner and other directors said they hoped Thursdays increases will be 
the last SMUD needs and that rates could decline in three to four years 
To boost conservation both SMUD and PGE are trying to craft rates that fall 
hardest on the heaviest household users 
SMUDs old residential rates were 
divided into a baseline tier charged roughly  cents a kilowatthour in the 
summer and one higher tier billed at  cents a kilowatthour 
The new rates will start at  cents in the summer rise to a middle tier of 
 cents and top out at  cents for those who use more than  
kilowatthours of electricity 
By comparison PGE has proposed to the state Public Utilities Commission 
that its residential rates be divided into four tiers topping out at  
cents per kilowatthour A PUC decision is expected next month 
Under the new SMUD rate structure including the surcharge large industries 
will see their electric bills rise by an average of  percent agricultural 
rates will rise  percent small commercial rates  percent and residential 
rates  percent 
Households that qualify for special lowincome or lifesupport rates will pay 
a smaller monthly customer charge of  and will not have to pay the 
surcharge on their baseline electricity usage 
Information about qualifying for the reduced rates is available from SMUD at

Lieberman to Bush Help California solve power woes
By Emily Bazar
Bee Capitol Bureau
Published April   
On a brief visit to the capital Thursday former Democratic vice presidential 
candidate Joe Lieberman called on President Bush to help rescue California 
from its deepening energy troubles 
After attending an earlymorning prayer breakfast with legislators and Gov 
Gray Davis the US senator from Connecticut met with them to discuss the 
federal governments role in easing Californias electricity woes 
Lieberman a potential Democratic presidential candidate in  warned that 
if the Bush administration does not act quickly in California the rest of 
the nation will succumb to economic ripple effects 
No American leader can disengage from a problem that so profoundly affects 
our largest state Lieberman told reporters after meeting with the 
Democratic governor I call on the president to get involved  We cant 
sit back in Washington and let California suffer 
Sacramento was the last California stop for the senator who has spent three 
days at fundraisers and speaking engagements across the state 
In talks with lawmakers about the energy crisis Lieberman told them hes 
strongly urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose temporary 
caps on the wholesale price of electricity 
But the commissions chairman Curt Hebert is a fierce freemarket advocate 
who has long opposed price caps and has not indicated he will change his 
mind 
If FERC doesnt act soon Lieberman said he will support legislation 
sponsored by Sen 
Dianne Feinstein DCalif to force FERC to impose temporary caps 
He expects Feinstein to introduce her legislation early next week 
Liebermans first stop Thursday morning was the California Prayer Breakfast 
an annual springtime gathering of religious and political leaders 
At the breakfast speakers told Davis they would pray for him as he navigates 
the states energy crisis Before launching into a song from The Scarlet 
Pimpernel singer Steve Amerson called on the governor to tell Californians 
the truth throughout the ordeal 
Davis was solemn in his remarks and his calm demeanor belied his behavior 
Tuesday when he reportedly erupted in an obscene 
tirade during a closeddoor meeting with Senate Republicans 
Im going to tell you the truth Steve We have a problem Davis said to 
the singer But God has provided a path out of that problem if we all do our 
part

Escondido calls a halt to power plant ideas 



Temporary step will give it time for overall planning
By Jonathan Heller 
UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 
April   
ESCONDIDO  After being inundated with proposals to build power plants in 
the past few months the City Council yesterday called a timeout 
The council voted  to suspend consideration for  to  days of any 
proposals to build energy generating facilities in the city During that 
period city staff members will develop a comprehensive approval process that 
will factor in the cumulative effects of such plants 
We need to step back and look at the direction were going in City 
Councilwoman June Rady said 


The city has been juggling four powerplant proposals since January 
Sempra Energy Resources wants to build a megawatt plant in the southwest 
part of Escondido It has not yet filed formal plans with the city Planning 
Department 
Ramco Inc of San Diego has received approval to build a megawatt plant 
on Mission Avenue in west Escondido 
CalPeak LLC of San Diego has filed plans to build a megawatt plant on 
Enterprise Street not far from the Ramco plant 
Another firm has expressed interest in building a megawatt plant on 
city property on West Washington Avenue but has not submitted plans yet 
Yesterdays decision means that all the projects  except the 
alreadyapproved Ramco plant  are now on hold and no new proposals can be 
filed with the city 
The decision halts a mad dash by developers to bring power plants on line by 
the summer to take advantage of special incentives offered by Gov Gray 
Davis 
Mayor Lori Holt Pfeiler and Councilwoman Marie Waldron opposed the move They 
said it would only delay muchneeded solutions to the regions energy crisis 
which is expected to come to a head this summer 
If plant developers have a chance of getting power on line by the summer 
we should not be the ones to stand in the way Pfeiler said 
Waldron argued that cities have to be more proactive at this time not less 
The governor is not solving the problem Waldron said Its up to local 
governments to try to do what they can 
Joe Rowley Sempras project development director said he doubted the 
councils decision would upset his plans 
Our timetable is still not fully defined Rowley said Obviously theres a 
lot of work we have to do to get to the point where an application can be 
processed 
Meanwhile council members listened to two people who made impassioned pleas 
for the city to consider alternative power sources 
David Drake a service architect for SAIC in La Jolla urged the council to 
think about solar power There is more than enough available land  and 
rooftop space  to install enough solar panels to power the whole city he 
said 
Escondido has  square miles he said But  acres could be employed 
to power us forever without any reliance on imported energy 
Local inventor Arnold Lund urged the council to consider energy generated 
from windmills 
The council also voted to work with San Marcos in exploring ways to seek 
inexpensive stable energy rates 
The hope is that the two cities can forge a deal with Sempra for cheaper 
rates Sempra officials have said they are willing to discuss possible rate 
deals with the city 
To buy power directly a city has to adopt a special legal arrangement such 
as forming a municipal utility district San Diego Gas  Electric is the only 
energy service provider in the county that buys and sells power from the 
regional energy grid 
San Marcos has formed a municipal utility district but has not signed any 
deals to buy power It would be a more lengthy process for Escondido to form 
such a district San Marcos is a charter city and has more flexibility under 
the state Constitution Escondido is a generallaw city 




Inflated naturalgas prices add to energy costs expert says 



Windfallprofits tax gets Davis backing
By Bill Ainsworth 
UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 
April   
SACRAMENTO  Federal regulators failure to stop what they described as 
anticompetitive practices in the naturalgas industry added  million to 
Southern California Edisons cost of electricity a consultant estimated 
yesterday 
The consultant Paul Carpenter of the Brattle Group spoke to an Assembly 
subcommittee investigating why California pays the highest naturalgas prices 
in the nation Natural gas is a critical part of the electricity crisis 
because most of the states generating plants run on natural gas 
Naturalgas prices have soared throughout the nation but the bench mark 
price paid at Californias border has been double that paid at other bench 
mark locations throughout the nation for months according to figures 
released by the Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight 
Next week Carpenter plans to testify at hearings in Washington DC on 
behalf of Southern California Edison and the California Public Utilities 
Commission which are asking federal regulators to intervene 
The giant utility and the state regulatory body contend that a sweetheart 
deal between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy gave the sister 
companies enough market power to artificially raise the price of natural gas 
that flows into Southern California from Texas 
El Paso owns the major pipeline bringing natural gas from fields in New 
Mexico and Texas to Southern California El Paso Merchant Energy is an 
unregulated sister company 
Carpenter called the prices paid in Southern California simply 
unprecedented in the United States He estimated that the sister companies 
manipulated the market enough to add  to the price of a million British 
thermal units of gas 
In addition he said El Paso Merchant Energy owns part of  smaller power 
plants qualifying facilities that get paid based on the price of natural 
gas in California The higher naturalgas prices increase the companys 
revenues Carpenter said 
El Paso company officials are expected to testify in front of the Assembly 
subcommittee today but in proceedings before the federal regulators they 
have denied any sweetheart deal 
In a report they commissioned the company blamed the higher naturalgas 
prices in Southern California on increased demand and constraints on pipeline 
capacity 
Gov Gray Davis meanwhile gave his strongest endorsement yet to a 
windfallprofits tax on generators as a Senate committee chaired by Joseph 
Dunn DLaguna Niguel began a series of hearings to probe possible price 
gouging by generators 
I believe the Legislature would be well within its prerogative to insist 
that generators receive an appropriate reduction whether its  percent or 
any other number the Legislature hit upon Davis said 
Senate Democrats Davis said will form a special committee to help work on 
his plan for the state purchase of the transmission system of Southern 
California Edison for  billion in exchange for state aid in paying off 
the utilities debt 
The governor said he told Senate Democrats a number of whom are skeptical of 
the plan that Edisons parent firm has agreed to back a  billion upgrade 
of the neighborhood distribution system retained by Edison and to return a 
 million tax refund to the utility 
At the naturalgas hearing yesterday state officials said that after El Paso 
Merchant Energy bought a significant part of the pipeline capacity from its 
sister company it withheld natural gas to drive prices up 
Marketers have gamed the system and figured out how to hoard capacity and 
undermine competition said Harvey Morris an attorney for the California 
Public Utilities Commission 
State regulators want the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which 
regulates natural gas to open the market to more competitors 
But the commission has repeatedly rejected similar complaints in the past On 
March  FERC ruled that the affiliates did not arrange a sweetheart deal 
The fact that El Paso Merchant controls a large volume of capacity does not 
in and of itself render the El Paso contracts unjust unreasonable or unduly 
discriminatory FERC ruled 
In other cases involving natural gas federal regulators acknowledged that 
certain contract provisions allowed anticompetitive behavior but they 
approved those contracts anyway 
Lawmakers said they were puzzled by the federal regulators lack of action 
It baffles me that weve found the problem  anticompetitive behavior and 
market gaming but theres no cure because federal regulators wont take 
action said Assemblyman Juan Vargas DSan Diego

Davis Congress members call for energy price controls 



By Gary Gentile
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
April   
LOS ANGELES  Gov Gray Davis and a bipartisan group of the states 
congressional delegates agreed Thursday that the federal government must act 
to control the wholesale price of energy 
For us the big issue is how we address the unjust rates said Rep Mary 
Bono RPalm Springs I believe we are up to it and will handle it as soon 
as we can 
Davis met behind closed doors with  congressional representatives 
including Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel near 
Los Angeles International Airport He said after the minute meeting that 
the group discussed a threefold approach to the states power crisis 
The strategy includes requiring federal agencies in the state including 
military facilities to conserve energy this summer and asking the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission to find a way to control the wholesale price of 
electricity and increase the flow of natural gas into California 
Davis repeated his criticism of federal regulators for not acting sooner to 
control the wholesale price of electricity and said he was hopeful the 
states congressional delegation could work together to find a bipartisan 
solution 
We agreed there has to be a mechanism to reduce the wholesale price of 
electricity Davis said We have agreed to work cooperatively across party 
lines to find ways we can reduce those costs Were in this together Party 
doesnt matter Finding a solution does matters 
To have the price of moving natural gas go up by a factor of  or more is 
absurd said Rep Brad Sherman DLos Angeles So many of our colleagues 
are telling us its Californias fault but California does not have the 
authority to regulate these two items 
The group also talked about easing environmental regulations during power 
emergencies to allow small companies and even military bases to run small 
generators 
If you have generators in the state regardless of what they run on because 
were entering this emergency period in the summertime and will be short of 
power you should be allowed to turn them on said Rep Duncan Hunter REl 
Cajon 
Hunter said small generators could produce about  to  megawatts during 
a power emergency if exemptions to various clear air requirements could be 
made 
Officials discussed ways to allow FERC to control wholesale prices without 
violating ideological positions staked out by highranking Republican 
officials including Vice President Dick Cheney who oppose price controls 
and favor free markets 
Rep Jane Harman DTorrance said she would support a finding by FERC that 
power wholesalers should not be allowed to charge market rates but rather 
rates more tightly pegged to the cost of generating power 
Were not talking about artificial caps Harman said We should insist 
that the FERC not renew their marketbased rate authority And if we go that 
route it takes us to the same place and avoids the ideological fight 
The meeting did not result in any specific proposals but participants praised 
the bipartisan nature of the talks and said it would result in a unified 
approach in Washington 
We have a responsibility to make sure the federal government takes its role 
seriously said Rep Gary Condit DModesto We clearly understand what our 
assignment is today and I think were going to work together in a bipartisan 
way to get that done 




Regulators open investigation into alternative power providers 



By Michael Liedtke
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
April   
SAN FRANCISCO  Hoping to prevent Californias bleak power outlook from 
becoming even darker state regulators Thursday launched an investigation 
into why alternative energy providers arent producing more electricity 
With the action the California Public Utilities Commission hopes to 
determine if legitimate business reasons or ulterior motives underlie the 
reduced output by an independent group of small generators that provides much 
of the states energy 
These alternative generators  known in the industry as qualifying 
facilities or QFs  have been scaling back or shutting down as debts owed 
by Californias two largest utilities pile up The QFs are owed an estimated 
 million by bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric and financially crippled 
Southern California Edison 
Some QFs say the unpaid bills have forced them to defer muchneeded 
maintenance leading to more equipment breakdowns that reduce electricity 
output Other QFs say they simply cant afford to keep operating 
The PUC is worried some QFs are trying to take advantage of the California 
crisis to get out of longterm contracts that require them to sell 
electricity at prices far below the current market rate Several QFs are 
suing to get out of those contracts so they can cash in on the open market 
said PUC Commissioner Carl Wood 
All the QFs want is to be paid for bills that date back as far as November 
said Jack Raudy a spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee 
which consists of  alternative power producers owed a combined  
million Those  generators produce about  megawatts  which Raudy said 
was enough electricity for  million homes 
We are outraged by the PUCs investigation Raudy said We have heard so 
much rhetoric over the past five months and still havent been paid a dime 
That is what we are worried about 
Raudy estimated his group is operating at about  percent of capacity 
After the temporary closure of several QFs contributed to rolling blackouts 
around the state last month the PUC ordered PGE and SoCal Edison to begin 
paying the generators for the energy purchased since March  
But the order has done nothing to help the QFs recover the past debts The 
QFs are now in line in bankruptcy court with  creditors owed money by 
PGE which expects its unpaid bills to rise to  billion by the end of 
this month 
If the QFs get desperate enough they may decide to push SoCal Edison into an 
involuntary bankruptcy case Raudy said 
PUC Commissioner Geoffrey Brown defended the alternative energy providers 
during Thursdays hearing 
Any QFs that are not operating right now are doing so for financial reasons 
not to game the system he said 
California will need all the power that it can get from the QFs this summer 
when rolling blackouts threaten to become a daily occurrence 
Combined the QFs account for about onefourth of Californias total power 
capacity according to the PUC 
The QF output will become even more essential this summer because California 
wont be able to import as much electricity from the Pacific Northwest as it 
has in the past A lack of rain has left the Pacific Northwests 
hydroelectric supply at its secondlowest level ever and it could diminish 
to a record low if the recent drought continues 
We are not going to be able to look to the Pacific Northwest to meet our 
needs Wood said after reviewing a new report on the hydroelectricity 
supply 
The looming blackouts and electricity price increases caused by Californias 
energy crisis is exasperating businesses and households across the state 
Fearing the frustration could boil over into terrorism the PUC Thursday 
installed metal detectors to screen everyone attending the agencys public 
meetings 
In other moves Thursday the PUC tabled a scheduled vote on whether the 
regulators should become more involved in PGEs bankruptcy case The San 
Franciscobased utility is challenging the PUCs authority in the case The 
PUC now expects to take up the matter at a May  meeting 




Attorney general taking two energy companies to court 



ASSOCIATED PRESS 
April   
SACRAMENTO  Attorney General Bill Lockyer wants a judge to order two power 
generators to hand over documents he subpoenaed last month as part of his 
investigation into the states electricity market 
Reliant Energy and Mirant Corp failed to produce certain documents by March 
 despite assurances that the sensitive documents would be kept 
confidential Lockyer said Thursday 
Lockyer filed the request for a hearing in San Francisco Superior Court 
Lockyer says the companies are concerned the documents wouldnt be kept 
confidential even though he says theyve been assured the sensitive 
documents would not be released 
The attorney general is investigating allegations of price manipulation in 
the states electricity market that may have led to soaring power costs 
Mirant spokesman Bill ONeel said the company is cooperating with the 
attorney generals office 
At this moment we have our legal team working to pull together the 
documentation the attorney general has requested ONeel said 
Mirant Thursday joined a complaint filed by Reliant last week in Los Angeles 
Superior Court That petition seeks assurance that the attorney general will 
keep proprietary information confidential to prevent any competitive damage 
said Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley 
Were committed to cooperating with the investigation that Attorney General 
Lockyer is conducting Wheatley said Its the understanding of our 
management that we do not have the proper assurance that the information will 
be kept confidential 




Legislators Unite Over Energy Price Issue 

Power Bipartisan congressional delegation called together by Davis says US 
must step in to protect state from manipulation by suppliers 

By MITCHELL LANDSBERG and MIGUEL BUSTILLO Times Staff Writers 

This may be the surest sign yet of the depth of Californias energy 
crisis A bipartisan crosssection of the states congressional delegation 
brought together Thursday by Gov Gray Davis not only agreed about the 
severity of the problem but also about the need for swift federal 
intervention 
This meeting did not have the word Democrat or Republican used 
once Rep Darrell E Issa RVista said of the unusual spirit of 
cooperation at the meeting near Los Angeles International airport
Members of both parties said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
must slash wholesale electricity prices so California utilities can once 
again afford to buy power Since January the state government has been 
buying electricity on their behalf as skyrocketing wholesale prices put 
Pacific Gas  Electric Co and Southern California Edison billions of dollars 
into debt and many power suppliers refused to sell to them PGE has since 
filed for Chapter  bankruptcy protection
Although the Bush administration has said repeatedly that it is strongly 
opposed to price caps and FERC has refused to grant them California 
Republicans at the energy meeting said they are optimistic that the 
administration will agree to some other form of price regulation They 
brushed aside the notion that such regulations might conflict with their 
ideological belief in a free market
This is not a freeenterprise situation Rep Duncan Hunter RAlpine 
said after the meeting In fact its just the opposite
Specifically citing the huge disparity between natural gas prices 
charged to California and those charged in other Western states he said 
California clearly has been the victim of unreasonably high energy costs 
Under federal law the FERC must regulate the prices of companies if it finds 
they are exerting market power to drive prices to unreasonable levels
Executives from two Texas energy companies meeting with legislators in 
Sacramento denied Thursday that they had caused natural gas prices in 
California to artificially skyrocket by hoarding access to a critical 
pipeline into the state
After the extraordinary meeting in Los Los Angeles Rep Brad Sherman 
DSherman Oaks said the biggest disagreement between California Democrats 
and Republicans appeared to be their relative faithor lack thereofin the 
ability of President Bush and his administration to help California There 
has been much speculation that Bush who lost California in November has no 
political motive to help the state
We Democrats said Sherman hope very much that our skepticism is 
proven wrong
Daviswho sat flanked by Democratic US Sen Dianne Feinstein and the 
governors newly appointed chief energy advisor S David Freemansaid he 
used the meeting mainly to discuss the importance of conservation by 
Californians this summer and to ask the congressional delegation to pitch in 
Five Republicans and more than a dozen Democrats attended the gathering
Feinstein said Thursday that she has asked for a third time to meet with 
Bush to discuss the energy situation Meeting with Times reporters and 
editors Wednesday she described a recent meeting with Vice President Dick 
Cheney in which she said he ignored her appeal for federal assistance 
Feinstein has been among those critical of natural gas companies saying 
they appear to have constricted access to a Californiabound pipeline to run 
up prices
The Brattle Group a respected consulting firm alleged Wednesday before 
an Assembly committee that Dynegy Inc and El Paso Natural Gas Co had 
manipulated the market by charging so much for the rights to their pipeline 
capacity that they had in effect withheld access to it
That action the experts said directly forced companies trying to 
deliver gas to California to look for alternatives clogging other pipelines 
and causing a surge in prices
The explanation El Paso executives said was simple Demand for gas 
soared in California because generators that use gas to make electricity 
increased production last year in response to the energy crisis
Were not withholding capacityno one is said El Paso Merchant 
Energy President Ralph Eads With these prices you want to sell every 
molecule
In other developments Thursday
 The agreement between Davis and Edison International to return its 
ailing utility arm to financial health is in deep trouble and could be 
rejected by legislators the Standard  Poors credit rating agency said in 
a note to clients citing legislative and other sources A rejection of the 
deal would be a humiliating setback for the governor SP said
The agreement calls for among other things the sale of Edisons 
transmission grid to the state for  billion and the sale of  billion 
in bondsboth designed to pay off the utilitys huge electricity debt 
Edison agreed to several constraints including the sale of electricity to 
the state at prices tied to the cost of producing power
Since they returned Monday from a twoweek recess state legislators 
have been sharply critical of the Edison agreement and have indicated a 
desire to tinker with aspects of the deal Some lawmakers have said publicly 
that a bankruptcy protection filing by Edison like that of PGE might not 
be such a dire outcome
But a senior Edison executive said it is way too early to give up on 
passage of the proposal which legislators have not yet seen in official form
There is an education process to do here the executive said of the 
highly detailed page document The legislators should be asking 
questions That is appropriate
 The Public Utilities Commission voted to investigate whether 
alternative energy providers violated contractual agreements by withholding 
supplies from PGE and Edison which owe them hundreds of millions of dollars
The action Commissioner Carl W Wood said was prompted in part by 
lawsuits some providers have filed seeking release from their contracts with 
the cashstarved utilities The producers of solar wind and geothermal 
energy account for more than  of Californias electricity supply
The question is whether we will be able to rely on them in the long 
hot days of summer Wood said
Jack Raudy of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee said the PUC 
needs to address the  million the producers are owed All we have gotten 
is rhetoric from the governor the PUC and the utilities he said
 An million plan to entice Californians to conserve precious 
megawatts appears to be running into roadblocks compounding predictions by 
state officials of tighter than expected energy supplies in May and June
Davis signed the conservation spending package last week earmarking 
 million of the new funds for the Public Utilities Commission to 
distribute to the states investorowned utilities to support existing 
conservation programs
But Barbara Hale director of the PUCs Division of Strategic Planning 
said Thursday that since Pacific Gas  Electric Co filed for bankruptcy 
protection April  the utility has stopped releasing conservation funds
Hale testifying before a state Senate committee said PGEs 
decisioncoupled with the threat that Southern California Edison could 
follow a similar route to US Bankruptcy Courthas complicated her agencys 
efforts
PGE spokeswoman Staci Homrig said her company plans to petition the 
Bankruptcy Court to have the conservation funds designated as a trust and 
separated from assets tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings She said if the 
court denies the request PGE would ask to be permitted to pay the expenses 
anyway The process she added could take about a monthtoo long in the 
view of some legislators given increasingly gloomy energy forecasts for late 
spring and early summer
Deputy Director Bob Therkelsen of the California Energy Commission said 
his agency had been counting on a number of small power producers to bolster 
their output during that period But he said some producers did not purchase 
the necessary equipment because PGE and Edison have failed to pay them in 
full for earlier electricity deliveries
Its not a huge amount he said of the anticipated production 
shortfall but every little bit helps

A San Francisco ice cream parlor a karate studio and a costume shop are all 
in the same boat and that goes for a Divisadero Street psychiatrist too 
Theyre all in the fortunate position of having money coming to them 
And theyre all in the tough spot of having that money owed by the sortof 
bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric Co 
Many of the  creditors that PGE owes money to according to a list 
filed with the bankruptcy judge are banks power companies lawyers and the 
like 
But a surprising number are businesses that at first blush might seem 
unlikely to be power company creditors Many businesses  like the ACT 
costume rental shop  didnt know or had forgotten that PGE had run up a 
tab 
And since the list didnt say how much theyre owed businesses had to guess 
How about that said costume shop manager Callie Floor when told she had 
PGE money coming to her 
Floor checking her books said it looks like PGE forgot to pay its  
bill to cover a costume rental for a corporate dressup party in  
We rent a lot of costumes for corporate events she said Thats probably 
what it was 
Psychiatrist Richard Lieberman says he does not know why or how much PGE 
owes him 
But Ill take it he said PGE has taken advantage of the consumer for so 
long As far as Im concerned PGE can go under and stay under 
Of course PGE may wind up paying pennies on the dollar if anything 
because thats how bankruptcies work The notion is depressing which 
psychiatrists are used to 
KARATE STUDIO GETS HIT
Karate master Scott Morton whose Karate One studio on Van Ness Avenue is 
also a creditor said karate is all about fairness and integrity which PGE 
seems to be even shorter on than cash 
I think the bankruptcy stinks Morton said All the money is going around 
and around its all the same company 
The karate studio conducted a selfdefense class for about a dozen workers at 
PGE headquarters Morton a black belt who does not take treachery lightly 
said he was pretty sure the check cleared but maybe not 
NO BIG DEAL FOR SOME
At Beauchamps Welding and Repair in Petaluma owner Dean Beauchamp wasnt 
concerned 
They dont owe us enough to worry about he said Less than  Id 
guess 
Beauchamps shop does small jobs for the big utility Theyve been really 
good about sending us a check Once in a great while something will get 
misplaced and I guess thats how our name got on the list 
Yolanda Fletcher the owner of Red Shoes Slide Service says the utility 
probably owes her about  for preparing some photographs for a corporate 
slide show 
Larry Mitchell proprietor of the awardwinning Mitchells Ice Cream shop on 
San Jose Avenue believes that PGE may owe him  for a corporate ice 
cream social 
That would cover the ice cream the toppings the dishes and the spoons he 
said 
The utilitys rocky road may be metaphorical but an ice cream stores rocky 
road is the real thing he said and being owed  by a bankrupt company is 
not peaches and cream 
UNEXPECTED NAMES
The list of creditors also includes such strange bedfellows as the San 
Francisco Fire Department the Yosemite Fund The Chronicle and PGEs own 
library petty cash fund Perhaps the strangest bedfellow of all is the 
perpetual PGE foe known as TURN or The Utility Reform Network which stands 
to lose thousands of dollars in statemandated legal fees from PGE for its 
work as an intervener or utility watchdog 
Among the utilitys more sensible business partners is the Beale Street 
sandwich shop a few steps from the main entrance to PGEs headquarters 
building in San Francisco 
Unlike the big banks and power companies that are on the hook for millions 
proprietor Kenneth Chen does business with PGE on a strictly payasyougo 
business 
Chen the owner of Cafe Leah at  Beale St is often hired to send up a  
tray of sandwiches to PGE corporate officers When he does so he insists on 
cash up front because PGE who is the restaurants landlord insists on cash 
every month from Chen 
Thats the way weve always done it payment right away he said That way 
theres no hassle later on

 Attorney General Bill Lockyer says he will go to court to force two 
electricity generators to hand over documents he subpoenaed as part of his 
probe of the states electricity market 
 Gov Gray Davis and a bipartisan group of the states congressional

  PDT BULLHEAD CITY Ariz AP  With many opposed to allowing 
Southern California Edison to increase power production at the Mohave 
Generating Station the City Council wants Nevada regulators to meet here 
The plant Edison operates is located across the Colorado River in Laughlin 
Nev Edison is seeking a variance that would allow it to exceed the current 
cap of  percent of the plants capacity and to do so for more than  
hours 
We just want to do this in dire circumstances to avoid the rolling 
blackouts California has experienced recently Edison spokesman Steve 
Hansen said 
Any is too much for former City Councilman Victor Urso 
That plant is one of the worst air pollution violators in the United States 
already and now they want variances to do even more damage Urso said 
Mohave County Supervisor Tom Sockwell who presents the Bullhead City area 
doesnt see it that way 
Theyll only run it up to full power for very short periods and we need 
that for the power shortages Sockwell said this week Weve already got 
pollution anyway so whats another hour of a darker plume every now and 
then 
Rick Moore of the Flagstaffbased Grand Canyon Trust which monitors the 
plants operation said the plant exceeded its permissible emissions level 
 times during the last calendar year The trust sued and the company 
was fined  
The City Council wants the Nevada Environmental Commission to meet in 
Laughlin next month rather than in Carson City so members can hear local 
opponents of Edisons request 
Hansen said the commission approved a variance last year but that the plant 
exceeded the emissions limit for only six minutes 
At peak capacity the plant can produce  megawatts of electricity but is 
required to stay below that level because of air quality concerns 
Edison owns  percent of the plant The rest is owned by the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power  percent Nevada Power  percent and the 
Salt River Project in Phoenix  percent

approval on Marcy  for at least  days In January the California Public 
Utilities Commission suspended sale of the Edison share and placed a

Edison pushes lawmakers to accept deal

NDTLtypenews 
Although lawmakers are skeptical of the states multibilliondollar deal to 
acquire the power lines of Southern California Edison the head of the 
utilitys parent company warned yesterday that failure to approve the accord 
could lead to a long and costly bankruptcy 
But John Bryson chief executive of Edison International told The Chronicle 
that he thought legislators would want to do the right thing by approving 
the multibilliondollar agreement and preventing Edison from following 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co into bankruptcy court 
Bankruptcy for Californias two largest utilities could have severe 
consequences for consumers Financial analysts said a worsening of the 
states energy mess would increase the possibility of higher electricity 
rates 
Nevertheless lawmakers are unlikely to accept the Edison deal  at least 
not in its present form 
We are going to go through this thing extensively said state Senate 
President Pro Tem John Burton DSan Francisco There are a lot of concerns 
about the valuation 
Still he said legislative backing for the accord remains possible as long 
as Edison is open to amending some of the terms 
The Edison people are smart enough to know that the Legislature is going to 
have its say Burton said 
Indeed sources familiar with the matter said Edison expected a certain 
amount of tinkering with the deal and would not resist efforts to reach 
common ground with lawmakers 
The Assembly members do not view bankruptcy as a favorable alternative 
said Assemblyman Herb Wesson DLos Angeles There will be a big effort to 
try and work something out 
Edisons Bryson seems eager at this point to present himself and his company 
as reasonable business partners who are willing to negotiate in good faith 
This contrasts sharply with the states relations with PGE which turned 
acrimonious after PGE blindsided the governor with its bankruptcy filing 
Each side blamed the other for the collapse of earlier negotiations 
We made the decision at an early stage that this was a massive problem for 
the state and that the best course was to find a practical solution that 
would allow us to get on with operating our power system Bryson said 
Bankruptcy he said is absolutely a last resort Its a long and costly 
process 
It is also the last thing Wall Street wants to see On Wednesday rating 
agency Fitch Inc joined Standard  Poors and Moodys Investor Service in 
warning that Californias credit rating could be lowered because of the 
states energy mess 
The state may be forced to issue junk bonds said Carol Coale an energy 
industry analyst at Prudential Securities in New York This could lead to a 
surcharge on electricity bills to guarantee the bonds 
Bryson not surprisingly defended Edisons agreement with the governor as a 
prudent alternative to bankruptcy 
This is a very good deal for the state he said It is not a bailout 
Edison gives up a lot to make all this possible 
Southern California Edison will sell its power lines to the state for  
billion It also will provide lowcost power to California for  years and 
drop a federal lawsuit seeking full recovery of nearly  billion in past 
debt 
Critics say the state is paying far too much for Edisons transmission system 
 more than two times book value  and that the power lines are of little 
use unless PGEs grid also can be acquired 
Its a multibilliondollar ratepayer bailout of Edison said Doug Heller a 
spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa 
Monica Edison gets off scotfree 
Under the most likely scenario lawmakers will seek to reduce the amount paid 
for Edisons power lines and to increase the role of the California Public 
Utilities Commission in regulating the utility 
They also will try to come up with a workable contingency plan for the state 
if PGE remains adamant in its refusal to sell off its part of the power 
grid 
The deal on the table is still salvageable said Michael Shames executive 
director of the Utility Consumers Action Network in San Diego But Edison 
needs to understand that what it got from the governor is only a framework 
not set in stone 
For his part Bryson signaled that plenty of room existed for give and take 
on the issue 
Were just at the initial stage he said We always have accepted the 
notion that Edison is a California regulated utility and is subject to the 
laws of the Public Utilities Commission

Who will pay the most for power 
Posted at  pm PDT Thursday April   
JOHN 
WOOLFOLK 

AND MICHAEL 
BAZELEY 
Mercury News 

State regulators last month announced an electric rate increase that would 
average a whopping three cents per kilowatthour hit bills beginning in May 
and punish power pigs while sparing energy misers 
Now much of that is up in the air 
Higher rates are surely coming  but not before June And exactly which 
consumers and businesses will pay how much is uncertain as regulators rush to 
forge a rate structure from a tangle of more than  proposals 
Their task has been complicated immeasurably by Gov Gray Davis decision to 
weigh in with a competing rate plan and Pacific Gas  Electric Cos move 
into bankruptcy court 
Little details are moving billions of dollars around said Nettie Hoge of 
the Utility Reform Network a consumer advocacy group 
All the proposals assume a tiered structure that forces the heaviest 
users of energy to pay the most But key details yet to be decided mean 
consumers could see their average rates go up anywhere from  percent to  
percent or more 
Among them 
How much of an overall increase The Public Utilities Commission approved a 
threecent per kilowatthour increase last month which would boost utility 
revenue by  million Davis proposed increase  left vague in his April 
 television address  averages  cents for PGE customers but only  
cents for customers of Southern California Edison 
What regions of the state will pay The commission agreed to raise rates 
only for PGE and Southern California Edison but Davis would include the 
additional  million San Diego Gas  Electric customers 
Should heavier users of electricity subsidize those who are exempt from the 
new rate increase If so those users will find themselves paying much more 
than any of the average increase figures being tossed about 
How will utilities bill customers retroactively for the increase At the 
time of the PUC vote on March  commissioners said their increase would 
take effect immediately 
PUC vote May  
Various plans are being presented this week to an administrative law judge 
working for the commission The judge is expected to recommend a rate 
structure to the PUC on May  Public hearings would follow May  and the 
commission would vote on a plan May  condensing to a few weeks a process 
that normally lasts nearly a year 
Each of the major proposals before the commission assumes that residential 
customers using less than  percent of their baseline  which is the 
average basic level of use for each region of the state  would be exempt 
from higher rates Thats mandated under a new law that allows the state to 
buy power Customers already pay higher rates for exceeding their baseline 
Each major proposal also sets new tiers with progressively higher rates 
for medium use at  to  percent of baseline and heavy use over 
 percent of that level 
But thats where the similarities end 
Differences 
The first distinction among the leading plans comes in the form of an 
assumption How many residential customers will avoid any increase because 
they dont exceed  percent of their baseline Davis says more than half 
commissioners say a little under half and PGE says less than a third 
The second difference among the plans is a real difference What happens to 
everyone else 
Under the plan by utilities commission President Loretta Lynch medium PGE 
users would see average bills rise  percent and heavy users would see bills 
increase  percent 
Davis plan says medium PGE users would see average bills rise  percent 
while heavy users would pay  percent more But the average total bill 
increase for PGE residential customers including those who are exempt 
would be  percent under his plan and  percent under Lynchs according to 
a statement on the governors Web site 
Business customers would see proportionately greater increases averaging  
percent under Lynchs proposal and  percent under Davis 
The most consumerfriendly of the various proposals comes from 
consumerrights group TURN They suggest an overall average residential 
increase of  percent 
TURNs plan assumes utilities cannot charge other customers more to make up 
for the energy misers shielded from rate increases under state law 
PGE disagrees with that interpretation The utility wants other residential 
users to make up for any lost revenue from exempted customers through higher 
rates Under the utilitys plan residential customers would see an average 
rate increase of nearly  percent 
The proposal these folks are pushing rips the heart out of that law said 
Matthew Freedman staff attorney for TURN 
Another issue affecting consumers is how the utilities can bill for 
electricity used in April and May before the final plan is approved 
Utilities want surcharge 
Utility officials have objected to making the rate structure retroactive 
Instead to recoup the revenue they are proposing a flat surcharge that 
everyone would pay regardless of how much they use 
Edison proposes a higher surcharge added to bills for a shorter period of 
time  in this case June through August PGE officials are suggesting a 
smaller surcharge that would be spread out over  months 
Itll probably be something closer to the PGE proposal said Paul 
Clanon the commissions director of energy issues 
All the rate increase proposals stem from a commonly understood problem 
Californias current frozen rates dont generate enough money to cover the 
wholesale price of power The PUC raised rates  percent  or one cent per 
kilowatthour  in January in an attempt to help but that turned out to be 
far from enough 
In March the commission approved an additional threecent increase But 
Davis followed quickly with an alternative proposal The next day PGE filed 
for bankruptcy raising the specter that a federal judge could order even 
higher rates 
Although the PUC has sole authority to raise rates under state law Davis 
proposal has complicated an already complex process The governor appointed 
three of the five members of the commission and his appointees seem inclined 
to show him deference But Davis has been slow in filing the details of his 
plan which has made it hard for the PUC to proceed









Creditraters put state on watch 
Posted at  pm PDT Thursday April   
BY JENNIFER BJORHUS 

Mercury News 


All three of the nations influential judges of credit risk now have 
California on a credit watch saying they are deeply concerned about the 
economic impact of the states power crisis 
The Fitch credit rating agency made it unanimous Wednesday when it warned 
that the thickening electricity quagmire as well as lower than expected tax 
revenues in February and March could mean broader risk for the states 
budget 
The announcement is a signal that Fitch too may downgrade its ratings on 
Californias nearly  billion in public debt a move which could cost 
taxpayers millions 
The announcement comes as state lawmakers consider a bailout plan for 
Southern California Edison Pacific Gas  Electric Co sits in bankruptcy and 
state officials bleed through the states general fund as they buy expensive 
electricity for consumers 
Earlier this week Gov Gray Davis announced that the average bill for 
electricity purchases has risen from  million a day in the last week of 
March to  million a day 
Moodys Investors Service and Standard  Poors have already issued their own 
credit warnings although none of the three agencies has downgraded the 
states very good doubleA credit rating 
Bond ratings are important yardsticks that bankers and investors use to price 
municipal and corporate bonds A downgrade would force California to offer 
bond buyers higher interest rates going forward costing taxpayers 
The state was last at a lower A rating back in  
Moodys changed Californias Aa general obligation bond rating outlook from 
stable to negative on April  the day PGE filed for bankruptcy Standard  
Poors has had the states AA rating outlook at negative since January when 
the state began buying electricity for the utilities 
The deciding factor for Fitch said Fitch vice chairman Claire Cohen was the 
disagreement over how the money from the new electricity rate increase will 
be spent 
The California Public Utilities Commission ruled in late March that money 
generated by higher electricity bills should go first to pay the state 
Department of Water Resources which has been buying electricity for the 
utilities PGE has argued that if the state is paid first there wont be 
any money left for the company 
The utility is formally challenging the PUC decision and the move threatens 
to hold up the estimated  billion to  billion of bonds the Department 
of Water Resources plans to issue to buy more electricity 
With that being appealed you dont have a clean authorization Cohen 
said It signals to me that it could delay the financing process 
A second concern is that the state isnt collecting as much in taxes as 
expected Cohen said Tax collections for both February and March were below 
forecast The amount of personal income tax the state collected in those 
months fell short by  million or  percent less than expected 
Cohen said she made her decision before hearing that the states power costs 
now exceed  million a day Cohen and David Hitchcock the California 
analyst for Standard  Poors agreed those rising costs are a definite 
concern 
It doesnt take much of a change in economic growth to make some of these 
projected fund balances disappear and so were very worried about what the 
current economic activity is particularly in Northern California with some 
of the problems with the hightech area Hitchcock told analysts and 
investors last week in a conference call 
Other economywatchers expressed concern 
Sandy Harrison assistant director of the state Department of Finance said 
the move reinforced the importance of solving the power problems soon

Power company executives going without bonuses 
LOS ANGELES AP  Senior executives at Southern California Edison and its 
parent company went without hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonuses in 
 because of Californias power crisis 
Edison Internationals chairman and chief executive John Bryson was paid 
 in  compared with salary and bonus totaling  million in 
 
Stephen Frank the chairman and chief executive at Southern California 
Edison was paid  in  compared with salary and bonus totaling 
 million in  according to the companys proxy statement filed with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission 
The company also said Thursday it would not award merit increases to 
executives in  because of the continuing crisis 
In a similar statement released Tuesday Pacific Gas and Electric Corp 
revealed it also withheld bonuses for its top two executives although they 
did receive raises 
Edison and PGE say they have lost nearly  billion since June to high 
wholesale prices that the states electricity deregulation law bars them from 
passing on to consumers PGE saying it hasnt received the help it needs 
from regulators or state lawmakers filed for federal bankruptcy protection

Edison is continuing to work with state officials and its creditors









Davis and US lawmakers call for price caps on power 
LOS ANGELES  Half of Californias congressional delegation gathered with 
Gov Gray Davis on Thursday to pressure the federal government to impose 
energy price caps 
Limiting wholesale prices they argued is essential if the state is to avert 
the energy crisis threatening Californias economy 
A big piece of this solution is federal Its a fourletter word 
FERC said US Rep Jane Harman DRedondo Beach referring to the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the agency that would have to approve 
price caps 
The governor has blamed FERC for allowing energy producers to charge 
California stratospheric prices for electricity and natural gas 
The delegation met behind closed doors at an Los Angeles airport hotel but 
Davis and several legislators met with reporters afterward 
The signal that has to come from FERC Davis said is Youre charging 
too much for electricity The electricity is not worth driving California 
into an economic grave 
Curt Hbert Jr the FERC chairman has argued that caps would encourage 
generators to sell their power elsewhere and discourage them from building 
new plants in California 
The bipartisan group of lawmakers agreed with the governor that the state is 
getting gouged on the open market 
There is an antifree market enterprise mechanism in play here said US 
Rep Duncan Hunter REl Cajon noting that natural gas in parts of New 
Mexico costs onethird what it does in California 
The generators maintain that they are charging fair prices that are the 
simple result of supply and demand 
Rep Mike Honda DSan Jose and Rep Zoe Lofgren DSan Jose attended but 
left before speaking with reporters









Generators cutting electric output regulators want to find out why 
Published Friday April   in the San Jose Mercury News 
BY MICHAEL BAZELEY 

Mercury News 


State regulators launched an investigation Thursday into why some alternative 
energy providers are withholding electricity from the states stressed power 
grid 
The California Public Utilities Commission in San Francisco said it wants to 
determine whether the small power generators  which provide about 
onefourth of the states electrical power  have legitimate business 
reasons for scaling back their output 
Known as qualifying facilities or QFs many of the generators have been 
either scaling back output or shutting down entirely  contending that the 
states two largest utilities owe them  million 
The critical question is Will we be able to rely on these facilities into 
the highdemand summer months PUC Commissioner Carl Wood said 
The financially strapped utilities Pacific Gas  Electric Co and Southern 
California Edison stopped paying the power generators several months ago 
The PUC ordered the utilities to resume payments and some generators started 
receiving payments this week 
But many generators are still hurting because of all the back payments they 
are owed said Jack Raudy a spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors 
Committee which consists of  alternative power producers 
Were outraged Raudy said

FERC remains an unlikely rescuer 
The federal agency hews to a handsoff policy on power rates 
April   
By DENA BUNIS
The Orange County Register
Washington  Californians who see federal reregulation of the states 
crisisbound energy market as an answer to the impending summer emergency 
better look for some other solution 
Even the possible short term price fix that the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission may consider at its Wednesday meeting might be too little too 
late 
Lobbyists lawmakers and other FERCwatchers say they have seen a slight 
shift in recent weeks among commission staff and at least one member There 
is some willingness they say to consider some price controls even though 
the Bush administration is adamantly opposed to such measures 
And many are looking to see if President George W Bushs choices for the two 
vacancies on FERC will provide a margin for change 
But the commissions basic philosophy that open unregulated markets are best 
is not likely to change soon members say 
Ive been championing a revamping of FERCs antiquated standards for 
determining marketbased rates Commissioner Richard Massey said Thursday 
But with no success  My agency is not on the verge of turning on a dime on 
this marketbased pricing 
The standards are a joke Massey added because the commission never turns 
down requests for such pricing authority More than  power sellers have 
been given that authority he said 
For a power company to be allowed to charge whatever the market will bear it 
must show FERC for example that it doesnt have the power to manipulate the 
market and drive prices up 
Any seller that cant pass our screen needs to fire their consultants and 
lawyers Massey said 
While the overall philosophy remains consistent FERC staff has proposed to 
the commission that a Stage  electricity emergency in California should 
trigger costbased rates a form of price controls Such triggers would be in 
place for one year under the staff proposal 
The commission may decide Wednesday whether to accept that proposal It has 
to make some decision by May  on how the market will be monitored from now 
on 
The theory behind controlling prices in Stage  says a FERC staff report is 
that during such an emergency generators have the greatest opportunity to 
manipulate the market and drive prices up 
But generators have that power during Stage  and Stage  emergencies says 
Les Starck Southern California Edison Cos manager of federal regulatory 
affairs Price caps during Stage  might avert the rolling blackouts 
associated with that level of crisis but they wouldnt do anything to stop 
generators from jacking up prices the rest of the time he said 
And it is not clear how long it would take for such price controls to take 
effect should the commission go along with the staff recommendation 
Were close because summer is approaching Commissioner Linda Breathitt 
said Thursday Breathitt who had firmly opposed any form of price controls 
said in an interview last month that given the worsening crisis in California 
she was open to considering some shortterm measures 
Its important to me that we address the summer Breathitt said but she 
said she could not predict what the commission would do Wednesday 
Even if an order is approved Massey said there could be delays while the 
power sellers file their costs with regulators and disputes over those 
filings are handled 
Sen Dianne Feinstein said Thursday such a move by the commission would be 
better than having no controls at all Theres no question that were going 
to be in a Stage  emergency 
Feinstein DCalif and other Western lawmakers have been urging FERC to 
step in sooner and with price controls that extend beyond just the emergency 
period 
Waiting for Stage  to intervene is putting the whole grid at risk said 
Roger Hamilton a member of Oregons Public Utility Commission We have a 
real stability problem when you cut it that close 
Feinstein says the future could well rest with the new commissioners 
particularly Patrick Wood the head of the Texas PUC who many believe will 
replace Curt Heber as FERC chairman if he is confirmed by the Senate 
Even if Massey and Breathitt agree on broader price controls as chairman 
Heber could block consideration of such a move Its unclear what stance Wood 
would take as chairman 
The thing that deeply concerns me about Pat Wood is that hes from Texas 
Feinstein said Whats reassuring is that it appears from my personal 
discussion with him is that he appears to be pragmatic 
But once again timing could be a problem 
Bush has said he intends to nominate Wood and Nora Brownell a member of the 
Pennsylvania PUC but has not formally sent their nominations to the Senate 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is of vital importance right now 
and to let the time go on without filling the spots makes no sense 
Feinstein said 
Please please please President Bush process your nominees 









Lawmakers seek bigger rollbacks cant agree on caps 
They promise to meet in Washington with a plan that would require federal 
agencies to conserve power this summer 
April   
By DENA BUNIS
The Orange County Register 
Los Angeles  Gov Gray Davis and a bipartisan sampling of the congressional 
delegation put politics aside Thursday and agreed something must be done 
about runaway wholesale power prices in California 
We agreed that there has been unreasonable or unearned enrichment by the 
energy providers of natural gas and electricity said Rep Darrell Issa 
RVista And we agreed that there needs to be significantly greater 
rollbacks than there already have been 
The lawmakers did not however come to a consensus over the issue of price 
caps  something Davis and other Democrats particularly Sen Dianne 
Feinstein DCalif have been pushing the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission to institute 
Davis met behind closed doors for  minutes with Feinstein and  of the  
House members at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel near LAX 
Participants from the Orange County delegation included Issa Rep 
Christopher Cox RNewport Beach Rep Loretta Sanchez DSanta Ana and Rep 
Gary Miller RDiamond Bar 
They emerged with a promise to meet again soon this time in Washington and 
with a fourpronged strategy to avert disaster this summer 
The strategy includes requiring federal agencies in the state including 
military facilities to conserve energy this summer and asking FERC to find 
a way to control the wholesale price of electricity and increase the flow of 
natural gas into California 
Cox said much of the meeting was spent reviewing Davis  million 
conservation program 
Members promised to get the word out in their districts about conservation 
measures 
Cox said he expects emergency legislation dealing with the energy crisis to 
pass the Energy and Commerce Committee in the coming weeks 
That measure he said will include a direction to FERC to expand its 
investigation of whether existing rates are just and reasonable

Assembly urges federal regulation of natural gas 
April   
From Register news services 
Sacramento  The California Assembly asked the federal government Thursday to 
regulate soaring natural gas prices once again 
A resolution passed  asked President George W Bush Congress and the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to restore the regulation of natural gas 
that ended in  
Natural gas rates at the California border have been as much as  times 
higher than elsewhere in the nation since November an industry consultant 
told an Assembly subcommittee Wednesday 
I think its only rational in one of the biggest crises to befall this

company out of its quagmire awarding stock options with a presentday value 
calculated at  million But Bryson wont be able to profit from those 
options  which vest over the next five years  any time soon The lowest 
price he can exercise the options at is   and Edison stock is trading at 
 
PUC seeks to shed light on meager energy alternatives 
Sacramento  Hoping to prevent Californias bleak power outlook from becoming 
even darker state regulators Thursday launched an investigation into why 
alternative energy providers arent producing more electricity 
With the action the California Public Utilities Commission hopes to 
determine if legitimate business reasons or ulterior motives underlie the 
reduced output by an independent group of small generators that provides much 
of the states energy 
These alternative generators  known in the industry as qualifying 
facilities or QFs  have been scaling back or shutting down as debts owed 
by Californias two largest utilities pile up The QFs are owed an estimated 
 million by bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric and financially crippled 
Southern California Edison

Shed light on costs 
Unfortunately California citizens will remain in the dark for at least 
another month about the details of Gov Gray Davis longterm contracts with 
power producers



This is the sort of crisis the public needs to scrutinize and for which the 
Public Records Act was designed

At a Tuesday hearing in a Los Angeles County Superior Court in Pasadena on 
whether the documents should be released under the California Public Records 
Act Judge Michael J Byrne said the case could better be heard in a Los 
Angeles court
The case was brought by Judicial Watch a Washingtonbased public interest 
law firm with its West Coast office in San Marino 
The case was reset for May  in a Los Angeles County Superior Court in the 
city of Los Angeles although were going to try to move it up a bit 
Judicial Watch and General Counsel Larry Klayman told us 
Mr Klayman remains hopeful Were confident any judge who sees this will 
have to release the documents he said
A similar but separate case brought by several newspapers will be heard May 
 in a San Diego Superior Court 
This is a huge financial burden on the taxpayers without an opportunity for 
the taxpayers to scrutinize the terms Hal Fuson chairman of the government 
affairs committee of the California Newspaper Publishers Association told 
the San Diego UnionTribune The general climate surrounding the governors 
approach to this has been one of secrecy
The governors position is that releasing the details now could make it 
harder for the state to get the best prices for electricity 
But given that the governor has mismanaged this crisis so far its clear 
that this is precisely the sort of crisis the public needs to scrutinize and 
for which the Public Records Act was designed
The governor should end this legal wrangling and release the documents to 
which citizens are entitled 





End To Deregulation of Nevada Power



CARSON CITY Nev AP via NewsEdge Corporation  
Gov Kenny Guinn signed a bill
Wednesday that would stop the sale of Nevada power plants halt
deregulation and bail out struggling utilities with a new rate
system


The Senate and Assembly gave the measure final approval earlier
in the day and rushed it to the governor The bill was crafted to
keep Nevada from suffering from a power crisis similar to
Californias


I must tell you this is a great relief said Guinn a former
utility executive as he signed the bill into law Nothing can
control escalating costs but were in the best position to protect
ourselves


Legislators made a lastminute change to add language that
ensured consumers would get a break on rates if utilities profit
from sales of excess power to other states


Guinn said the bill takes care of the most pressing energy
issues but other deregulationrelated bills are sure to follow
That includes a plan that would allow major power users such as
casinos and mines to buy power on the open market


Legislators also are working on plans encouraging energy
conservation and ensuring the poor can pay their utility bills





PGE Co Issues Statements On the Increase in the States Cost for Power



SAN FRANCISCOBUSINESS WIREApril   via NewsEdge Corporation  

FROM   John Nelson Director of the News Department Pacific Gas and


Electric Company


There seems to have been some confusion yesterday over the effect
Pacific Gas and Electric Companys bankruptcy filing may have had on
energy prices I thought it might be helpful to provide a few useful
facts and figures to help you pin down the truth behind what may be
driving the states energy costs higher


Yesterday Governor Davis claimed that the state was paying
roughly  million more for electricity every day as a direct result
of the bankruptcy filing by PGampE While its understandable even
laudable that the Governor would want to fully explain the downsides
of utility bankruptcy this claim is simply not accurate The Governor
should know better


Consider the facts


  On January  the credit ratings of Californias two largest


investorowned utilities  PGampE and SCE  were downgraded to


below investment grade by every major rating agency


Generators immediately raised concerns about continuing to


sell power to such noncreditworthy entities


  The state reacted by passing ABx which authorized the state


Department of Water Resources to make  million in power


purchases Less than two weeks later on February  the


Governor signed ABx which authorized DWR to buy power on an


ongoing basis at least through  until the utilities could


be restored to creditworthiness The clear understanding in


the legislative debate was that the DWR would purchase the


full net open position which is the amount of additional


generation needed beyond what the utilities themselves own or


have under contract to meet customer demand


However a few weeks later in spite of the clear intent of


state law it was revealed that DWR was not buying the full


net open position and had no intention of doing so It was


only buying power that it considered reasonably priced and


was leaving the ISO to buy whatever was necessary to keep the


lights on  an amount that most estimates place at  to


percent of the states daily electricity need


  The ISO in turn revealed its intention to attempt to pass


along the costs of these lastminute highcost spotmarket


purchases to the states noncreditworthy utilities despite


existing FERC tariffs which precluded the ISO from doing so


PGampE has estimated that its share of these costs was roughly


 million a day SCE has a similar estimate We dont know


for sure because we havent seen the bill The DWR wont say


how much power its buying and at what cost and neither will


the ISO


  On February  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission


informed the Independent System Operator that it could not


force generators to sell to noncreditworthy entities namely


both PGampE and SCE This order appeared to force the DWR to


purchase the full net open after all The ISO responded the


next day with its own interpretation of the FERC order saying


the order was limited to emergency power only The ISO also


sought and obtained in federal court a temporary restraining


order issued by Judge Damrell forcing generators to


continue selling to it


  On February  five power generators filed a complaint with


FERC seeking to clarify that the ISOs interpretation of the


February  order was contrary to FERCs intent


  On April  the Ninth US Court of Appeals reversed Judge


Damrells lower court order affecting one of the generators


Reliant saying the generator was no longer required to sell


electricity to the ISO without assurances of payment


Presumably this order would apply to other generators if they


sought such assurances


  On April  PGampE noted in the announcement of its Chapter 


filing that one of the reasons for the decision was the


financial exposure to unreimbursed wholesale energy


procurement costs caused by the states failure to assume the


full procurement responsibility


  On April  unrelated to PGampEs bankruptcy filing FERC issued


an order responding to the generators Feb  complaint


against the ISO In this new order FERC reaffirmed its


February  order that the ISO could only buy power on behalf


of creditworthy entities meaning neither PGampE nor SCE


  On April  in remarks reported in the press the Governors


office acknowledged the States bill for energy purchases


will increase by upward of  million a day after a ruling


last week by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission once


DWR started buying the full net open position rather than


force the ISO to try to bill the utilities It seems likely


that the  million was an estimate based on only one of the


utilities costs not the combination of both


  On April  the ISO discontinued its daily practice of


publishing the total amount it spent on energy the day before


  Despite the history the state continues to try to avoid


buying the full net open position On April  in response to


the FERC order  NOT the PGampE bankruptcy filing  the ISO


sent a murky notice to generators promising that any bid


accepted by the ISO will be deemed to have the financial


support of another Qualified Party or DWR as specified in this


notice Generators were reportedly underwhelmed by the


assurances contained in the letter


  Yesterday in response to the Governors claim that bankruptcy


was driving up the states costs Gary Ackerman spokesman for


the Western Power Trading Forum said I dont believe nor


have I ever heard of a bankruptcy surcharge being added to


the cost of power If anything I think that generators and


marketers would take solace in the fact that bankruptcy brings


order to an otherwise volatile situation


What does it all mean Clearly the increase in the states costs
have come as a result of the DWR finally covering the states energy
needs as promised in ABx This change in DWRs buying habits has
come as a direct result of the February  and April  FERC orders
that the ISO only sell to creditworthy entities These orders were
issued independent of PGampEs bankruptcy filing and apply equally to
PGampE and SCE


Neither PGampE nor SCE have been creditworthy since midJanuary
when their credit ratings were reduced to below investment grade and
the DWR ISO and Governors office have been aware of the effect of
the FERC order since midFebruary


Some generators have suggested that California has been paying a
credit penalty since December when the utilities deteriorating
financial situation gave rise to payment concerns There appears to be
far more evidence that the states coy approach to ABx implementation
has created far more uncertainty in the marketplace than has PGampEs
Chapter  filing

JD Power and Associates Reports  Nationwide Decline in Customer 
Satisfaction of Electric Utility Service Among Midsize Businesses




Price and Value Performance Hit Hard Across Nation


Satisfaction in California Continues to Plummet


AGOURA HILLS Calif April   PRNewswire   Midsize business customers
who are responsible for approximately fifteen percent of the nations
electricity consumption are very critical of electricity prices according to
the JD Power and Associates  Electric Utility Midsize Business Customer
Satisfaction StudySM released today  Consequently the studys nationwide
customer satisfaction index fell  from  points in  to  in

The entire country was affected by higher natural gas prices this winter
and with more states reevaluating deregulation midsize business customers
are especially sensitive to electricity prices said Jeffrey Conklin senior
director at JD Power and Associates


The  study shows that average overall customer satisfaction with
Californias big three investorowned utilities  Pacific Gas and Electric
San Diego Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison  fell an
astonishing  index points among midsize businesses compared to the
 study


In California electric utility satisfaction among midsize business
customers has virtually fallen into the Pacific said Alan Destribats
executive director of the utility practice at JD Power and Associates


The study finds that the chief determinants of satisfaction among electric
utility midsize customers are a providers company image price and value and
power quality and reliability


As expected midsize business customers were extremely critical of
performance in the areas of company image and price and value  Even outside
of California satisfaction in the price and value component fell more than
any other factor  from an index score of  in  to  in 


Power Quality and Reliability


Utility performance in power quality and reliability is improving with
the national index increasing by  points  Although the number of
interruptions and outages experienced was relatively the same in  as it
was in  midsize businesses report much shorter outage durations falling
from an average of seven hours for the longest outages in  to four hours
in 


Retail Competition


Opening utility markets to competition has proven to be a difficult
process and so far midsize business customers are giving the industry poor
marks said Destribats


The study shows that midsize business customers located in states with
competition not only are less satisfied than are customers in other states
but they are also significantly less satisfied now than last year  The study
also shows that more midsize businesses have switched electricity providers
Of midsize businesses eligible to switch power suppliers  percent have done
so up from  percent in 


JD Power and Associates interviewed representatives from more than
 midsize businesses including manufacturers retailers business and
consumer services firms health care providers and other midsize businesses
throughout the United States  Midsize business owners are defined as those
who normally spend  to  per month on electricity  The study
shows that midsize businesses are now spending an average of  per month
on electricity


The study shows that utilities in the south region of the United States
consistently receive higher ratings across all factors of customer
satisfaction  Likewise these midsize business customers also report the
lowest levels of monthly electricity expenditures on average  Midsize
businesses in North Carolina spend the least for electric usage  per
month on average while those in New Hampshire Nevada and Utah spend the
most  to  per month on average  The study also shows that
midsize businesses in Alabama and Florida report the most service
interruptions and outages within the past  months and those in Washington
report the fewest


East Region


PPL Utilities serving east Pennsylvania ranks highest in overall
customer satisfaction with midsize businesses in the eastern United States
PPL Utilities ranked highest in the East Region in four of the six factors
that comprise customer satisfaction with its primary strength in price and
value  Other solid performers in this region include Public Service Electric
and Gas Allegheny Power and GPU Energy


Midwest Region


LGampE Energy the parent company of Kentucky Utilities and Louisville Gas
and Electric ranks highest in overall customer satisfaction with midsize
business electric service in the Midwest  LGampE Energy midsize business
customers give high ratings for power quality and reliability customer
service and billing and payment  Alliant Energy AEPMidwest and Xcel
EnergyNSP also rank high in midsize business customer satisfaction in the
Midwest Region


South Region


Southern Company ranks highest in overall customer satisfaction for
midsize business electric service in the South Region and received the highest
customer satisfaction index score among all utilities included in the study
Southern Company dominates all other electric utility service providers
achieving the highest ratings in the nation in five of the six components
 in a tie  Other strong performers in the South Region include Duke Power
Florida Power amp Light and Progress Energy Carolina Power amp Light and 
Florida
Power


West Region


Sierra Pacific Resources ranks highest in overall customer satisfaction
with midsize business electric service in the West Region  This utility
significantly leads the region by rating highest in all six components  in a

Mark 

Thanks for the call a couple of weeks ago regarding our new ad campaign  The 
challenge as I understand it is that we have difficulty in quantifying the 
benefit and effectiveness of our ads   We can measure on a periodic basis 
what the CEO CCO CFO perception of Enron is on a periodic basis but this does 
not break down the impact of our PR efforts from an ad campaign   I 
understand this dilemma

But one thing that we could measure that is quite important to me is what our 
employees think about these ads    If all else fails these ads should make 
our employees proud to work for Enron  and this is something we should be 
able to measure on a consistent basis

I know you have an upcoming event in California where your organisation will 
talk about problems and challenges we have  so if you could consider this 
idea I would be very appreciative  And of course dont get to hooked on 
Gods country while you are in Napa

Thanks

Subject Re Greenpeace letters to Enron Europe concerning our position on 
Kyoto  

All  I would like to discuss how we might respond to this letter from 
Greenpeace if at all  The letter is attached way at the bottom of this 
email and was received in several Enron European offices as a copy of what 
was sent to Jeff Skilling and other CEOs of major companies  I have not 
confirmed our receipt of such a letter from any of you but am assuming it 
was delivered

I think we could respond in a very positive constructive manner to 
Greenpeace based on the statements weve already documented and the 
strategies we are developing  Lisa Jacobson and I are currently working on 
developing some tighter climate change and clean air messages that we can 
use in multiple areas ASAP  upcoming Ken Lay speeches and interactions with 
the Administration revising the Statement for the  Corporate 
Responsibility Report Enron Business articles and other internal uses 
responses to environmental group inquiries and shareholder meeting QA and 
use in everyday speeches and advocacy work

The Greenpeace questions are tricky and set up nowin answers for the most 
part  I doubt they will get any direct answers to questions like  Does 
your company support President Bush in his opposition to the protocol   In 
my opinion we can respond to Greenpeace without directly responding to these 
types of questions  Addressing Kyoto directly is a slippery slope  its 
best to stick with the solutionoriented approach weve always taken

For this reason I was a bit concerned to see in the email chain below a 
characterization of Mark Palmers statement on Kyoto given to Jackie Gentile 
in London  Enron has always taken the view that the Kyoto protocol was 
not a workable solution to dealing with CO emissions  However it is not the 
principles behind Kyoto that we take issue with rather it is the vehicle 
that has been devised to deliver the results  I believe it is dangerous to 
make such statements for a number of reasons  Greenpeace would absolutely 
beat us over the head with it Friends of the Earth could step up its 
shareholder initiatives etc    Also this sets you up for a number of 
follow up questions that I dont think we have answers to like  What about 
Kyoto is not workable  What would make it workable and would we help make it 
workable  If not Kyoto what is Enrons preferred vehicle  Id really 
rather stay with a constructive solutionoriented approach and avoid 
reference to Kyoto altogether

I will talk with Kate Bauer in Enron Europe about this but I think we need 
to decide on a global corporatewide response to Greenpeace   I would be 
happy to set up a quick conference call on the subject or just field 
comments by email  whatever works best

Further to my telephone message today I would be grateful for your view on
the approach we should be taking to the issue of Greenpeace sending letters
to our European offices re Kyoto Several of our offices Spain Belgium
Netherlands have received a local language version of the letter
originally sent to Jeff Skilling and other CEOs on  April  The
email chain below gives an indication of what is in circulation

Greenpeace is expecting a response within the next week Jackie Gentle has
made me the point of contact in the PR department for this issue We have
discussed this issue briefly and we would support issuing an initial
statement to acknowledge receipt of the letters perhaps followed by a
standardised corporate approved letter but would like to ensure our
approach is supported and consistent with any actions by Corporate As
some of the countries in which we operate have tangible green focused
projects eg we have acquired a wind project in The Netherlands it may be
appropriate to allow such countries to personalise their response in local
language

If we follow up an initial acknowledgement with a fuller response to
Greenpeaces questions I suggest we consider the following issues raised
recently by Jackie Gentle

In response to several requests for clarification I have spoken with Mark
Palmer who has provided the following information on Enrons stance
regarding Kyoto

Enron has always taken the view that the Kyoto protocol was not a workable
solution to dealing with CO emissions  However it is not the principles
behind Kyoto that we take issue with rather it is the vehicle that has
been devised to deliver the results

We firmly believe that there is work to be done in reducing greenhouse
gases and Enron has put in place a number of programs that have measurably
reduced carbon dioxide as well as SO and Oxides of Nitrogen Nox

By way of example 
   emissions trading programs have been put in place where these can be
   implemented
   Enron is one of the largest developers of natural gasfired power plants
   which produce about  percent less carbon dioxide than coal or
   oilfired plants
   demandside management programs through EES to reduce energy usage
   the Catalytica program
   focus on renewablerelated projects

At the current time there is no formal statement from Enron Corp on the
Kyoto issue

Before we proceed I would be grateful if you could contact me to share
your views on this

Many thanks
Best regards
Kate

2001-04-17T08:59:00-07:00,"No charges  I think we should refer these to Carrie Robert and ask her to 
run down the people in the organization most likely to have an interest  In 
this case I would get in touch with Andy Fastow Ben Glissan or someone in 
the finance group in London  That way we can make a better determination 
about the value of the relationship make sure those who are interested in 
pitching them on doing bus with Enron can be involved Or we can make a 
determination to decline  I think we decide who we want to let in then do it 
for free rather than charging

Subject Re ISO Market Stabilization Plan  

Tim  although theres always a chance my impression is that the FERC wont 
buy the ban on exports as this would appear to run afoul of the Commerce 
Clause and certainly goes counter to everything that FERC hopes to accomplish 
with their own Order  and  initiatives  I am less certain about the 
direction FERC will go on pricing since even the staff has recognized 
stumbling blocks in their own recommendation and offers possible variants  

The ISO has not submitted revised tariff sheets for approval yet so it is 
unlikely they would try to implement their own plan in the near term  If 
they try to do so without FERC approval possible legal avenues might include 
the filing of a complaint at FERC asking for fast track processing this 
fast is measured in weeks not days and or seeking injunctive relief in 
court faster which can be hard to obtain but not impossible depending 
entirely on the circumstances

The IT group put it like thisJustification  Current Server is  PL

That means that our current system
 has a slow processor
 is nearly out of memory for stock award administration
 doesnt have a realtime back up in case the hard drives fails
 needs to be upgraded

The IT group has quoted about  for a new system that brings this 
server up to Enrons current server standards and takes care of the above 
issues

Let me know if this expense is a problem and whether you need to be involved

Subject Interesting Idea for Enron

Hi Amy  Kelly Kimberly got this letter from a woman she knows who works at 
Harvard in the Kennedy School of Government for an initiative called Women 
Waging Peace  Enron is a supporter of WWP and Joe Sutton is on their 
corporate cabinet  What do you think about her idea below and Enrons 
involvement if any  Please feel free to pass this along to others who you 
think might want to consider it or who might be more appropriate to consider 
it
Thanks Stacy  x

I have an interesting idea that I wanted to share with you  Just last week
here at the Kennedy School I met with a woman named Susan Bird who sits
on the Womens Leadership Board of the Kennedy School  She is the Founder
and President of Womenfuture in New York City NY  She headed the launch
of the organization part of which was held here at KSG the main body of
which was held in NYC and telecast to KSG  It was a masterfully conceived
and brilliantly orchestrated threephase global event for businesswomen  I
imagine you heard about it

Susan told me last week that one of her current burning interests is in
how women business leaders corporate leadership across the private and
public sectors can change and influence public policy  She wants to
create a public venue invite women business leaders and discuss the
central question If we assume that todays global problems require more
and more from the business world would these problems look any different
if women business leaders owners were involved

Susan and I wonder if this is something Enron and or potentially other
corporate sponsors would like formally to sponsor   Furthermore Susans
company could video this executive forum streamline the video and link it
to the Women Waging Peace Website  My sense is that its a winwin for
everyone

I told her that I would contact you and discuss the possibility  Would
love to hear your thoughts first before I engage in further conversation
with Susan  If this is something in which Enron is interested I could
easily arrange a phone conversation among Swanee Susan you and me in the
near future to discuss the idea in greater depth

I am available for a conversation about the idea anytime and I can be
reached directly at

2001-04-15T12:45:00-07:00,"Thanks so much for your message  Your communications are always complete 
firm clear and polite  I am sorry that perhaps the most critical aspect of 
your efforts  security has been so confused by our end  I understand 
from John Brindle that the confusion generated by our end has not kept you 
from accomplishing a great deal of the work anyway  I have asked John to 
lead the effort to the extent you need him  John and his team are very 
experienced and have been in contact with and coordination with the London 
office  Mike Hicks is a good hand but for the most part all I have asked 
him to do is be in a position to identify outside resources skilled in the 
area in question  It is a bit too much to ask Mike to be hands on for all of 
Enrons corporate security needs  A little background Ill bore you with  
after Andre Legallo formerly VP of Security for Enron left we did not 
replace his function  Most of the operating companies had their own security 
and business controls groups  When Andre left we reduced the corporate 
function to a default provider role  if a business unit had a need it was 
not otherwise meeting Mike Hicks as well as an outside consulting firm 
would help identify competent resources in the area  With the reorganization 
of EBS I have inherited the very competent and experienced team they had 
assembled led by John Brindle  John identified some concerns regarding 
India mid last week  I urged him to get in touch with Rebecca he did  It 
was clear after further inquiries by John that the India team had already 
addressed many if not all of the concerns and much of the remaining work 
involved implementation  John volunteered to send some people over to help 
and I said OK  He had already been in touch with the London team and Mike 
Hicks who I have asked to return to Houston

The last thing you need right now is confusion caused by a group saying 
were from corporate and were here to help  If you dont need any help 
or if the situation gets anything other than significantly better let me 
know

quality of the India HR team and their preparedness The HR team is doing an 
outstanding job and I wanted you to hear that from me Once we realized we 
had a major issue on our hand and I received clearance from Rebecca and Jim 
to bring some HR folks into the loop HR had someone on a plane within  
hours of my first call We have always had great HR support through Drew 
Lynch and Bob Sparger helping our team led by Sandip Malik and this time 
Scott Gilchrist has joined in and helped as well But the two workhorses have 
been Bob and Sandip Bob got on a plane immediately and came over and he and 
Sandip have been working around the clock so that we are much better prepared 
now than we were just a couple of days back We really relied heavily on HR 
and Drew had his team there for us

 PR top notch team of John Ambler and Johan Zaayman working with and 
supporting Jimmy Mogal on the ground Johan and Jimmy have been a strong team 
on the ground and John has provided leadership and all coordination with 
Houston Great efforts and productive work

 Security This area has not worked as well and if you ever want feedback 
on our onetime experience with this group I will provide it I dont have 
any idea who is in charge from Enrons perspective here There are  groups 
headed this way Mike Hicks will arrive Thursday night and Mike has informed 
us that he will be leading all security efforts Jim Rountree is apparently 
travelling with Mike and Don Hawkins sent me an email earlier today telling 
me that Don has instructed Jim that Jim is in charge of coordinating our 
security John Brindle has sent me an email saying that you have asked him 
to coordinate and help in the ongoing efforts and John is sending  people 
over arriving Saturday night First we are very happy to have the help but 
I just hope that Mike Jim and John know which of the three are in charge If 
you could just let me know who you want to be in charge we will coordinate 
with that person

On a side note the people who have really been helpful were brought in 
through Drew Lynch of Europe HR They are Jim Roth and Dave Lawler both of 
whom work for John Sherriff They had a great attitude were willing to work 
day and night and were planning on coming to coordinate until Mike decided he 
would come

At Mikes earlier suggestion we engaged Hill  Associates to help on 
security Because I was having to meet with them  to  times per day I 
asked Jane Wilson to help coordinate all our security efforts Jane has done 
a fantastic job in an impossibly short time frame The tasks she has been 
overseeing include coordinating with Hill  Associates removing in a lowkey 
yet rush manner over  boxes of files and documents and getting them 
through customs and to Europe removing  container truck loads of files from 
the Dabhol site and getting them out of the country and overseeing a 
complete security check and file removal of all our electronic files from 
servers desktops and laptops In addition she has coordinated security for 
all expats and families as well as worked with EOGIL expats and Anthony 
Duenner of EBS Asia

Again we appreciate all the help 

Wade

Subject Budget transition info

Hi Steve  

Dennis Vegas has requested budget information from Kelly on the people from 
EBS that are transferring over to Corp  Kelly is on vacation now for the 
next week and a half and I wanted to check with you to make sure that it is 
OK to share these documents with him  They are what Kelly reviewed with you 
in your initial meeting regarding the subject  He only asked for information 
on the people shifting to Corp not the people on redeployment so I could 
delete that portion of these documents  Perhaps I could only send him the 
first document that is about budget but with the redeployment information 
taken out

Sorry to bother you but I am concerned about doing the right thing and 
following protocol in Kellys absence

Thanks Stacy

Subject Summary of the MOU

The following is an outline of the basic terms of the Southern California 
Edison Memorandum of Understanding

 Commitment to Provide Power  SCE will keep its current generation plants 
and other generation assets and commit them to provide power on a regulated 
costofservice basis for  years
 Dedication of Power  Edison International will commit the entire output of 
Sunrise one of Edison Internationals nonregulated generating facilities 
to the State on a fixed price basis for  years Phase I of Sunrise is to be 
brought online by August   If not brought online by August   
Edison International shall be assessed a  million penalty
 Transmission Sale  SCE will sell to the State its transmission assets for 
approximately  billion  times the net book value of the assets 
subject to certain adjustments Of the  billion the  billion gain 
on sale will be used to reduce SCEs net undercollected amount as of January 
  In connection with the purchase the State will also assume certain 
liabilities associated with the transmission assets
 Backup Transaction  If the transmission sale does not occur within two 
years for reasons beyond the parties control then if the State elects SCE 
shall sell to the State SCEs hydro generation assets If the hydro assets 
are not worth  billion then SCE will also sell the state after December 
  enough belowmarketpricepower to make up the shortfall
 Conservation Property  SCE shall grant perpetual conservation easements to 
the State covering approximately  acres of its Big Creek hydroelectric 
related lands and  acres of its Eastern Sierra hydroelectric related 
lands  Some of the land may be deeded in fee
 Contribution by Edison International  Edison International will refund to 
SCE not less than  million  This money will consist of a refund of 
approximately  million in estimated  quarterly tax payments plus 
approximately  million in federal loss carryback tax savings
 Investment  Edison International and SCE will invest not less than  
billion over the next  years in capital improvements for SCE
 Litigation  SCE shall dismiss certain claims including its takings and 
filed rate doctrine cases
 CPUC Regulation  CPUC shall continue to regulate SCE using historical 
principles of ratemaking
 Payment for Portion of QF Dropoff  SCE shall pay an amount that 
represents that portion of the net short from January   to April  
 that is attributable to QFs not selling to SCE due to SCEs failure to 
pay the QFs  SCE will securitize this amount
 Securitization  SCE shall securitize its full net undercollected amount 
approx  billion  The securitization shall occur in two tranches ie 
two different nonbypassable dedicated rate components

 The first tranche will occur after the passage of legislation and the 
signing of the definitive agreements and will cover the net undercollected 
amount less the gain on sale plus interest on certain obligations in the 
net undercollected amount
 The second tranche would be triggered if the transmission sale does not 
occur within two years  Accordingly the second tranche would not show up in 
rates for two years if at all

 Buying the Net Short  The State will be required to buy the net short 
through December    After  SCE will be responsible for covering 
the net short
 Investment Recovery  SCE shall have an authorized rate of return that will 
not drop below its current rte  during the  year cost of service 
ratemaking period
 Next Steps Definitive Agreements and CPUC Action

 Definitive Agreements  Once the MOU is signed the next stage is to 
negotiate definitive agreements which contain the specific terms of the 
transmission sale as well as the specific terms of the various other related 
agreements eg the OM Agreement Transmission Services Agreement and the 
Facilities Services Agreement
 CPUC Action  Prior to entering into the definitive agreements the CPUC 
must undertake certain actions which include establishing mechanisms for 
preapproval of procurement costs and URG costs deferring SCEs general rate 
case until  granting SCE some relief from direct access credits and 
clarifying the first priority condition in the holding company act"

Subject help with neighborhood

Steve

I am having a problem with the drainage in our easements in my neighborhood 
and Kevin Hannon suggested I email you  I live in Garden Oaks which is 
located off of the  North Loop between Shepherd and Yale near the 
Heights  Our neighborhood was built in the early s and the city put 
in open drainage which is basically ditches in the front of all the 
properties  Over the past  years the drains have filled in and leveled 
which is preventing the water from flowing correctly to the sewers and this 
in turn causes minor flooding and BIG headaches  

My address is  W th Street and the area of th Street I am asking the 
city to regrade is between Ashland and Yale approximately  feet  I 
have been calling the City of Houston Public Works Department  
for about the last  years generally once a month to ask them to please 
come out and regrade our ditches  The Public Works Department only has 
records over the last year because they changed their computer system and 
lost many files including mine  For the last year or so I have been 
receiving a more positive response when I call which is This is a Code  
priority and will schedule as work load allows  Although this response is 
encouraging I still feel that my request is falling on deaf ears  

Kevin suggested that perhaps a call or letter to a city council person might 
help expedite this work request  I would be extremely grateful if there is 
anything you could do to help me and my neighbors

  I have made a change as we discussed about geographic responsibility 
given my conversation with you that I think it is a bit misleading to only 
show these people in many areas being responsible for Power when in fact 
they are responsible for Gas too  Doug is really responsible for gas as 
an adjunct to their local efforts as well as a change to indicate also as 
we discussed that these responsibilites are flexible in response to 
changing commercial priorities as well as the need to support the other

Please review the attached draft org annoucement and send me your comments   
Mark  please let me know once
we have spoken to the five senior managers in your group as we do not want to 
send this out until either you Michael or
I have spoken to them about this structure


Draft

After nearly five years in London Mark Schroeder will be returning to the US 
on April th to join the North American Coal Business with responsibility 
for origination in the utility sector  Under Marks leadership his team has 
made significant contributions towards Enron Europes first mover advantage 
and its status as the leading new entrant in the liberalizing panEuropean 
energy markets  We wish him well in his new commercial role 

With Marks departure the daytoday management of the Government  
Regulatory Affairs Department in Europe will rest with Peter Styles Paul 
Dawson Paul Hennemeyer and Doug Wood  Nick ODay will continue in his 
current leadership capacity in Japan  Each of these five individuals and 
their groups will now jointly report to the business heads and to Rick 
Shapiro in the Government Affairs team in Houston Rick Shapiro will 
continue to manage Government Affairs for the Americas  While the team 
members responsibilities will vary from timetotime in response to shifting 
commercial priorities as well as the need to support other Enron Wholesale 
Services business units from timetotime the general areas of 
responsibility will be as follows

Peter Styles based in Brussels will continue to have responsibilty for our 
EU and Netherlands advocacy   Paul Hennemeyer will lead efforts in the 
German speaking countries Germany Austria Switzerland as well as France 
and Belgium  Peter and Paul will report to Eric Shaw  While secunded to the 
commercial team in France Philip Davies will address Nordic market issues on 
an ad hoc basis and also report to Paul on these issues  

Paul Dawson will lead our UK Spain and Italian power regulatory efforts as 
well as the gas regulatory work in the UK  Doug Wood will support the 
Continental Gas team and the Central and Southeastern Europe Origination 
efforts while also addressing the UK Climate Change Levy  Dougs role in 
gas will continue to be to supplement and not to supplant the efforts of 
each of the team members geographic responsibilities noted on the 
organisation chart  Paul and Doug will report to Richard Lewis locally

Nick ODay will also continue to report to Joe Hirl in Japan  

Other regulatory support provided by Mark Schroder will be addressed in 
another organizational announcement that will be sent
out from Governmental Affairs in Houston  Attached is the revised 
organization chart that now reflects the Governmental  Regulatory Affairs

"
2001-04-09T08:12:00-07:00,"Per our discussion this morning below is a summary of items to discuss with 
Glynn

Adding Enrons negative CTC claim to the list of claims PGEs filing 
included a list of top twenty creditors  Our negative CTC claim was 
apparently not taken into account in compiling that list  The list is 
nonbinding however  PGE will be required to file schedules of creditors on 
April   Our negative CTC claim should be on Schedule F for unsecured 
claims  You may want to remind Glynn of your previous conversations and 
state our expectation that the negative CTC claim will appear preferably as 
uncontested in the April  filing Note if PGE does not include the 
claim we have an opportunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the 
court determines the validity of the claim
Including Enron on the Creditors Committee  PGE may have the opportunity 
to influence representation on the creditors committees  There are several 
reasons to suggest to Glynn that we be included  we are a big creditor  
we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution and  we are one of the 
real parties in interest behind the PX and ISO who were listed as 
significant creditors but are really just passthroughs for the suppliers

Since Enron and EBS are trying to cut costs and be more cost effective why 
would a vice president need an executive computer setup at home  Especially 
if they already have a laptop provided by Enron  they take home every night 
and have taken advantage of the Click at Home program as well  Since Enron 
has gone through the expense of giving each and every employee the 
opportunity of the Click at Home program it seems to be a somewhat redundant 
expense of which I might add is unnecessary in my opinion

I feel it would behoove ALL EMPLOYEES including executives to be more 
conscientious of costs and expenses to improve Enrons and EBS bottomline  
How can we Enron be a world leading company if we dont have leading 
world leaders that spend Enrons money as if it were there own

I think it would be in Enrons best interest to set some guidelines regarding 
expenses such as these  Just because a person is an executive of the company 
why should be allowed to have anything they want just because they can

Thank you for your time and the opportunity to express myself  Especially 
since I am a shareholder also and care where the money goes

Subject FW Financial Times article

Mark  This is the article I mentioned in my voice mail  For the record I
have said early and often that the interagency disputes among the
financial regulatory agencies which the Administration of George HW Bush
inherited and did not create by the way are unacceptable and must be
avoided  The Dems of course love to get this sort of thing going as it
enables them to hold hearings on the need for further legislation to
reregulate The fact that this Presidents father came to the White House
in the denouement of a multibillion dollar savings and loan crisis which he
did not create is also usually forgotten

As I said in my voicemail and as the attached article confirms I think
there is no substance to the rumor that Sen Gramm would be opposed to my
nomination  As one of the few who contributed generously to his own
Presidential Exploratory Committee in  I think I stand in pretty well
with the Senator and we would work well together  After our last meeting I
think he would feel the same way

Dear Steve

Jim Bushnell and I are teaching a course called Energy Market Strategies
and Policies this semester  The course is crosslisted between the Haas
School of Business and the Energy  Resources Group at UC Berkeley  The
syllabus for the course is attached

We have  graduate students in the course most pursuing a masters degree
in business or energy  resources though there are also a few PhD
students  These are very smart students  many of whom already have
experience in the energy industries  and we believe the course puts them
in a position to immediately contribute to any energyrelated organization
that they would join

Many of these students are interested in either summer or permanent
employment starting as early as May  If Enron has openings that you would
like to advertise to these students please send me the job description
or the URL for itand I can forward it to the class list

Jim and I think this is a very strong class and many of the students are
interested in making a career in either the business or the public policy 
side of
the energy industry  Were hoping to provide the connections to help make 
sure
they find the best job matches possible

Sincerely
Severin

Can any of you meet with Professor Littlechild on  April  He has a small 
consulting services contract with me to write on liberalisation of energy 
markets  his current work is devoted to among other thins debunking 
Joskow et al on the argument that most of the benefits of liberalisation 
are cpatureed at the wholesale level and he argues that a 
working funcitoning retail market and corresponding contracts market for 
risk management is paramount to ultimate success very Enron  He comes 
across very much as an academic Jeff Dasovich heard him speak on this 
subject in San Francisco and he has spoken in Tokyo and very Staid 
British but he was electricity regulator in UK for  years and is 
indisputably a top academic so he carries some status when he speaks  i

Subject White House Talking Points and Abraham Mtg with EPSA

  I am faxing to you a bootleg copy of the draft talking points Ed received 
this morning at the White House energy messaging meeting  These are very 
close hold   Ed asked that we not circulate these to anyone  Ed asked us to 
give him feedback of any concerns we have with the talking points he will be 
giving them comments  After glancing at the TPs the obvious missing point 
is open access  However I am not sure we should be alarmed about that  
There really isnt any policy in the TPs  This is a typical WH message 
document   Let me know if you think it is imperative to insert open access  
Also Ed would like to position us as the coalition leader of the White House 
outreach effort  Any thoughts 

  I am faxing to you EPSAs summary of the generators meeting with 
Secretary Abraham  I am glad I did not attend this meeting  As you will see 
from the summary there were three parts to the meeting  a an exchange of 
policy views both long and short term b discussion of how to maximize 
generator output in Calif and c a request that industry participate in a 
DOE reliability group  I dont see any follow up for Enron outside of our 
normal course of activities and independent interchange with DOE officials  
Let me know if you have additional thoughts

		 Subject request to CERA

Steve 
Thanks for your note sorry I missed you  From your message I think there 
may be some miscommunication between your PR guys and us  We understood that 
your PR people wanted to reprint the Oped and redistribute it to 
asyetundetermined people along with various Enron material  They also 
wanted to post it on Enrons public web site
But your message seemed to indicate you just want to post the oped on your 
intranet   for educational use only for your internal folks  If this is 
correct we would have no problem with it In fact we have posted the oped 
on the CERA web page  which is theoretically available to every Enron 
employee for internal use only  If you want you could just post a link to 
the CERA web site so your people could get direct access to all our research 
on the topic
If I misunderstood you and you do want to redistribute the piece to 
thirdparties  that is a much bigger issue because it involves our 
intellectual property and  branding issues  Obviously we would need to talk 
some more about this  I hope this helps
On a somewhatrelated note we are also getting sucked more and more into the 
California vortex and being asked to help in areas that are not our 
traditional business such as expert witness testimony and policy issues  
While we are not afraid to take a point of view as you know we must 
maintain a neutral and independent posture  This is sometimes a difficult 
path to navigate but we are exploring two areas that may also interest Enron
 We have examined Joskow and FERCs analysis on the price gouging issue and 
we believe there are several major flaws in their methodologies  We are 
considering how best to broadcast our assessment without impinging on our 
core business or becoming an expert witness  We think a workshop similar 
to the Monday event at CERAWeek could work where we would present our 
findings and issue a report
 We are also looking into the economic impact of power outages in the West 
 especially linked to the overall fragile state of the US economy  This 
would be a collaborative effort with a major economic forecasting firm or 
university  Again the reults would go to our clients but could be released 
to a wider audience and a workshop might help highlight the release
Please let us know if either topic would be of interest to Enron  We would 
need to raise funding from various clients to help underwrite the effort  
but the work would be CERAs independent research and we would stand fully 
behind it
Hope all is well Peter

Your DC team   Hillings and then Briggs were instrumental in pressuring the

setting legislative affairs strategy and developing a plan for contacts on 
the Hill will give Cynthia the idea that she can run all aspects of those

Nice job  Can you imagine the fun someone is going to have if a Region
say SPP MAIN MAPP WSCC or FRCC has a major blackout this summer and the
loyal opposition discovers that said region has refused to sign an
agreement such as this and not implemented the program required by the
agreement  That may even constitute willful neglect  Wouldnt it be even
worst if the discovery showed that the region was not signed because the
region wanted to use its position as a bargaining ploy SPP FRCC and
WSCC Oh no I sound like a wantabe lawyer

Subject Compliance Agreement


Regional Managers
Compliance Task Force

As we discussed on the conference call on Friday I have prepared a simple
draft letter of intent for the use of those regions who wish to indicate
support for the regional compliance and enforcement program but are not
yet in a position to sign the Agreement for Regional Compliance and
Enforcement Programs that the NERC Board of Trustees approved on February


For the benefit of those who were not on the call Id like to recap where
things stand at this point  My apologies if I mischaracterize anyones
position  NPCC and ERCOT have signed the agreement  ECAR has stated it
will sign the agreement at the signing ceremony on March   SPP is
prepared to sign the agreement but doesnt want to be the only one it its
part of the Eastern Interconnection to do so  FRCC was not on the call
but has previously stated that it is prepared to sign so long as at least
six regions sign  MAPP and MAIN have indicated that they prefer to develop
their program with their own members before they sign the NERC
agreement  WSCC may need to consider the matter at its Board meeting in
early April  SERC has the matter under consideration  I have not heard
from MAAC but it has a meeting scheduling for March 

I want to share with you my concern for the climate in Washington  In the
past few weeks I have had occasion to speak with a number of people on
Capitol Hill and in the new Administration  All are very concerned about
what might happen this summer  If a serious incident occurs I am quite
sure that Congress will legislate very quicklywhether it will legislate
wisely is a different question  We have the opportunity with this
agreement for the industry to take charge of its own destiny  If Congress
acts it may well assign a very central role to the Federal government to
take direct responsibility for reliability  There are those in the
Department of Energy who are pushing for such a role   Congressman Barton
is talking of the possibility of emergency legislation possibly within the
next few weeks  If the industry pulls together I believe we can forestall
direct governmental controls just as in   If the industry does not
step up then Congress may well assign the responsibility elsewhere

The CTG recommended to the Board that a critical mass of six Regions sign
onto the agreement before it goes forward  For those Regions that are
considering developing their own programs with their members before they
sign the agreement with the view of having the CAPG determine in advance
whether their programs meets the requirements of the agreement I ask you
to consider this  If we dont get a critical mass of Regions to sign then
the CAPG may not come into existence

The NERC Regions agreement is really an undertaking by the regions to work
to develop their own regional compliance and enforcement program with their
members  My request remains that each of the regions sign the agreement by
the March  Board meeting  That will assure that we are able to make the
governance changes that we have all been working for  If any region is
unable to sign by March  then use of the letter of intent would be a way
to demonstrate support for the program  That may be enough to satisfy
those who have stated that moving forward on the compliance program is a
condition to their support of the governance changes

Thanks very much for your consideration of the program and all the work
youve put into this transition so far  Please let me know if you have
questions or if there is anything that we can do from here to be of
assistance to you

Steve    

FYI  we conducted a postevent survey on opinions about the HR employee 
meeting held last month and the HR management team thought you should know 
that participants rated your presentation very high

When asked what should be kept the same next time participants commented as 
follows about your presentation
I think a presentation from Corporate HR is of great value
Keep the presentations by the officers    to talk about the business
I liked having other people from ETS Enron there to better understand the 
big picture and where Enron is going
Continue to bring in invited guests to keep the group apprised of Corporate 
activities I liked the opportunity to hear both Stan and Stevethe field 
staff dont get as many opportunities to hear from corporate management
Visits by Steve Kean and Stan Horton Their perspectives are very good   

Clearly your participation provided much value to the group and we 
appreciate very much your taking the time to come meet with us and share 
information 

You should expect that well be asking you to come back again

Wanted to give you brief feedback on our efforts to become the st Fortune 
 Company that has a  green headquarters  Weve established a 
companywide team and a working plan going forward which includes

  EES commodity team is going to run the numbers for energy commodity for 
facilities and give them a proposal by end of next week  While facilities 
will not be part of the TX pilot EES can arrange a financial deal for them 
w  an option of going physical on      EES commodity team will also let 
the group know of the offer in order to structure the REC deal  Depending 
upon the savings that EES can offer to Facilities we will determine any 
headroom for REC purchases
Note It is not necessary for Facilities to sign a commodity deal w  EES in 
order for the greening of the building to go forward  The RECs can be 
purchased and retired irrespective of the commodity deal with EES  HOWEVER 
it would be optimum for Facilities to sign on w  EES and use the cost savings 
toward purchase of the RECs  Facilities stated intent to do the latter
 Michael Payne and Mike Curry are going to be working on determining a cost 
for the RECs  Michael initially projected  per year for the 
requisite number of RECs to retire commensurate w  the demand of the 
building  This was at a cost of  per REC which I believe is quite high  
I think theyll go for a  dollar range bringing the cost down to a max 
of   Theres several ways to slice this end  We can provide some of 
the RECs from the EWC facility and buy other RECs from the market in order to 
minimize the cost impact of the REC purchases
  Next Thursday we will be able to get more of an exact figure on the 
premium cost for the RECs ie how much over the cost savings will the RECs 
cost  We will then need to decide the following
 a Would Corp EHS being will to pitch in to cover any additional cost for 
the RECs
 b Pitching the idea to Skilling for buyoff and payment for the RECs
 c Possibly getting buyoff from the business units since this could change 
what they are currently paying for power
 We discussed all of the above with Peggy Mahoney and she asked us to take 
a stab at a comprehensive press release announcing all of the bells and 
whistles on the new building and our being the st Fortune  company to go 
 green in our headquarters   Catherine McKalip Thompson is working on 
the first draft  We need to determine if we can get the best press for 
this commitment ie stories in the WSJ and NY Times  We determined that 
the message would need to be targeted specifying the terms of our 
commitmentie Enron makes a commitment for  years to provide  green 
for its headquarters in Houston making it the first Fortune  company 
to

The goal is to have a final plan and decision by April th when Steve speaks 
to high level executives at a prelude to Earth Day NY on the topic of Energy 
ShockCrisis or Opportunity Building Economics and the Environment

Mike well definitely need your continued support and assistance 
particularly if this goes to Skilling  Ill keep you posted on the progress

You are invited to a meeting next Thursday   afternoon at  to 
discuss energy commodity and renewable energy credits for the Enron Building 
Center and Stadium  There are a few efforts that are going on simultaneously 
and I thought it would be a good idea for all of us to meet and get on the 
same page  As many of you might know Enron Wind Michael Payne and ENA 
Mike Curry have a great proposal to retire renewable energy credits from 
our Enron Wind facility to match the consumption of the building and stadium 
details attached below  If this proposal goes forward Enron would be the 
st Fortune  company to go green in its headquarters building  Couple 
this w  our energy star award and we have GREAT environmental messaging   
Wed like to highlight this announcement on Earth Day April nd

The facilities folks are interested in switching from Reliant to EES for 
actual commodity  It makes sense to work strategically together on winwin 
proposal that will not only make sense economically but that we can use in 
our messaging  The focus of the meeting is to discuss the various proposals 
and steps for moving forward   

The meeting will be in EBMO from  Please let me know if you or 
someone from your group can attend

directly
And Id like to reiterate Laurens suggestion that the article should direct 
employees to our climate change policy statement in last years EHS Report 
and that Lay encourages them to research and reflect on the issue and 
communicate their thoughts

KEELER EDITS
Here is my draft for Ken in response to Anns eBiz request  Comments welcome


The President after a good deal of study and soul searching decided not to 
support mandatory controls on carbon dioxide CO emissions from power 
plants as part of a multipollutant clean air strategy   His decision was 
based on some very important factors  the nations energy markets are 
experiencing unprecedented supply and price challenges that any CO mandate 
could exacerbate and US regulation of CO in the nearterm could be 
illadvised because the Kyoto protocol on global treatment of greenhouse gas 
emissions is unworkable in its current form  

I was somewhat concerned that the message sent by the Bush administration 
would polarize the debate over how the US should treat CO emissions in the 
long term as his statement did provoke a very negative antienvironment 
reaction by many concerned individuals and organizations  Because this is an 
important issue to all parties on all sides of the debate I believe that the 
administration should convene an ongoing process to carefully examine global 
climate change and all the longterm economic scientific and social impacts 
of action regulate CO emissions

The Presidents position on CO notwithstanding Enron continue to be a 
private sector leader in offering real solutions towards reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions in a rapidly expanding energy market  We are wellpositioned 
through our experience with lowcarbon fuels for electric generation natural 
gas and wind in particular our focus on new power generation and 
tecnologies our leadership position in promoting efficiency through Enron 
Energy Services energy outsourcing business and our expertise in emissions 
trading and risk management

A multipollutant appraoch to reducing power plant emissions makes a lot of 
sense from and environmental and energy policy standpoint  Enron will 
continue to work with the Bush administration and Congress toward structuring 
a program that can achieve environmental goals while providing incentives to 
build cleaner more efficient generation promoting a broad mix of fuels and 
tecnologies and giving industry the flexibility and economic incentives to 
make reductions in a marketbased costeffective way  If were able to make 
meaningful reductions in  pollutants  NOx SO and mercury  and we do it 
in a way that promotes efficiency and new technology well make progress on 
CO whether it is regulated or not

In the meantime I will remain active in the global climate change debate to 
position Enron as a constructive player in the public policy arena and as an 
industry leader in promoting marketdriven solutions to the worlds energy 
and environmental problems

Hi Mr Lay

I am a Specialist in Corp PR under Karen Denne and write for our internal 
eBiz publication  I am working on a story about the recent issue with 
respect to carbon dioxide emissions and Enrons position compared to 
President Bushs as well as the coal industry  

I know that Bushs viewpoint on this issue is not to regulate carbon dioxide 
emissions from coalburning power plants I also understand he based his 
decision in large part due to a recent Department of Energy report that warns 
that such a policy would lead to an even more dramatic shift from coal to 
natural gas for electric power generation and significantly higher 
electricity prices causing problems similar to California   

I wondered if you would mind adding first hand knowledge for employees  A 
quote from you about this issue would be great  I would also be interested 
in giving employees some of your reasons for being in favor of controlling 
CO such as your idea for a credit trading system for CO

Thank you for your time and please let me know if you have any questions  

Thanks
 Ann Schmidt

increases

Power Hogs May Get Hit In Pocketbook 
Davis favors tiered rate increases 
David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer
Sunday March   
 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL 
http  wwwsfgatecom cgibin articlecgifile chronicle archive    M
NDTL 
Gov Gray Davis faced with the near inevitability of raising consumers 
electricity bills is leaning toward a rate system whereby those who use more 
power pay more than those who conserve The Chronicle has learned 
Sources close to the governor said he is being lobbied by his own staff 
members to accept a socalled structured rate system 
Top officials from his own administration told lawmakers Friday that the 
state may end up spending more than twice the  billion previously 
estimated to purchase power on behalf of Californias nearbankrupt 
utilities 
If so the officials warned that consumers electricity rates could double 
In the case of Pacific Gas and Electric Co this would mean customers 
average monthly power bills would rise from  to  
Consumers throughout the Bay Area believe that at least some increase is on 
the way 
Were going to have to bite the bullet and pay the money said Larry 
Webster a retired Caltrans worker in Redwood City We might as well admit 
that electricity is no longer a nickel Its a dime If youre going to use 
it 
lets pay for it 
Steve Maviglio a spokesman for the governor distanced himself yesterday 
from estimates that rates would double The figures reported in the press he 
said were wildly high 
The governor still believes he can live within the existing rate structure 
 Maviglio said Until we know the results of the negotiations with the 
utilities you cant conclude anything 
The state is negotiating a multibilliondollar bailout package with PGE and 
Southern California Edison Co to relieve the utilities of about  billion 
in debt 
PGE and Edison have been saying for months that there is no way California 
can overcome its current energy woes without higher rates The irony of the 
Davis administration now saying the same thing was not lost on the two 
companies 
The state is in the exact same position the utilities were in last fall 
said John Nelson a PGE spokesman Either wholesale prices need to come 
down or retail prices need to go up The disparity is too large 
Statewide blackouts last week drove home the precariousness of Californias 
energy situation to ratepayers  and may have served as a blessing in 
disguise for the governor 
COST VS OUTAGES
If given a choice between further outages and paying higher rates many 
consumers said they would accept increases in their power bills 
I dont like either choice said Janet Leroux facing the possibility of a 
gooey mess if the air conditioning goes out at her downtown San Francisco 
candy store But I guess Id go with higher rates I sure didnt like the 
blackouts 
Publicly the governor has been insisting for weeks that rates will stay 
within the existing rate structure  a stealthy way of saying that 
Januarys  percent increase and an expected  percent increase next year 
will remain in place 
But privately he and his staff are discussing additional rate increases that 
could be spread over as long as  years sources said 
Utility executives and power generators told The Chronicle last week that a 
minimum  percent rate increase lasting up to a decade is in the cards 
For the good of California its inevitable said Gary Ackerman executive 
director of the Western Power Trading Forum a Menlo Park energy industry 
association 
Sacramento resident John Hax observed that when temperatures soar in the 
Central Valley this summer hed be more than willing to pay a higher price 
for power if this keeps the air conditioners on 
Its like gasoline he said I dont like paying higher prices for 
gasoline but thats the price of doing business 
Ratepayers draw the line though at any increase topping  or  percent 
If it was  percent Id probably do it said Tracy resident Mark 
Dougherty But if it was more like  percent Id rather go with rolling 
blackouts 
Id rather have blackouts agreed Jenny Soghomonian owner of a shoe 
repair shop in San Franciscos Financial District I dont want to pay rates 
that are so much higher 
NOT EVERY COST PALATABLE
This is the tightrope that state officials and industry players now find 
themselves walking While consumers may be willing to pay more to avoid 
blackouts they arent willing to swallow virtually any cost thrown their 
way 
Yet if rates are not high enough they may not prevent daily blackout threats 
this summer and beyond 
Higher rates are the price signal that it takes for conservation said Tom 
Higgins senior vice president of Edison International parent company of 
Southern California Edison 
Simply put he meant that most consumers will not aggressively conserve 
power and thus alleviate shortages unless there is a financial incentive to 
do so 
Rebates proposed by the governor have met with only a lukewarm response 
requiring critics say too much effort on the part of individual ratepayers 
But a sudden spike in monthly power bills almost certainly would prompt 
widespread conservation measures 
It adjusts consumer behavior Higgins said People want to get their bills 
back down 
RATES EFFECT ON USAGE
He and other industry sources said higher rates are perhaps the only way 
Californians will achieve the  percent conservation goal sought by the 
governor  a move seen as vital if blackouts are to be avoided this summer 
Its intellectually dishonest to think theres any other way out of this 
Higgins said 
Consumer activists initial reaction to any talk of a rate increase comes 
across loud and clear No no no 
No bailout No rate increases No secret deals said Harvey Rosenfield 
head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica We 
need to get back to a regulated system 
Rosenfield is the biggest fly in the governors ointment He has threatened 
to push through a ballot initiative reregulating Californias power market 
if Davis cannot find a consumerfriendly way out of the current fix 
Because of Rosenfields past success in writing a ballot measure on insurance 
rebates which delivered about  million to consumers his threat is taken 
seriously in Sacramento 
Weve paid too much already Rosenfield said A fair price is what we were 
promised by deregulation which was a  percent rate decrease 
However when he was asked whether there was any room to discuss a structured 
rate increase such as the idea being promoted by the governors staff 
Rosenfield toned down his characteristic rhetoric 
Big users should pay more he said after a moments reflection Im open 
to a tiered system but only if its fair 
Rosenfield quickly added that he would have to see how other consumer 
advocates felt about the matter before agreeing to negotiate such things with 
Davis 
MOVE TOWARD STRUCTURED RATES
Clearly though momentum is building toward a system of structured power 
rates which probably would include increases of varying sizes for consumers 
The California Public Utilities Commission is scheduled to address Januarys 
 percent rate increase on Tuesday That increase originally was given only a 
threemonth duration but most observers expect it to be renewed for at least 
another three months if not longer 
PUC President Loretta Lynch declined to comment on the likelihood of rates 
going up but added her voice to those backing a structured system 
I am a fan of restructuring rates to exempt conservation she said People 
who use a whole lot of power should pay more 
The biggest electricity customer in the state is the state itself now that 
California is purchasing power on behalf of its cashpoor utilities The 
state already has spent about  billion buying electricity and has yet to 
determine how the cash will be recouped from consumers 
San Francisco resident Rosita Magee accepts that for California to find its 
energy footing once more rates will probably be heading up That way you 
have more convenience and electricity more stability she said 
But Magee has come up with another solution one that doesnt involve rate 
increases and rolling blackouts 
Shes moving to Texas

Please find below some emails between EFET European Federation of Energy 
Traders and myself  We have helped them to find out which German 
journalists the German gas incumbent Ruhrgas has sent to California this 
week  We found out about that yesterday  I have now passed on that list  
some general PR recommendations and EFET will now take the lead on this they 
will send out an EFET position paper on California and have a spokesperson 
available especially for California  hes not Enron

Just wanted to make sure you are aware because it could be possible that 
people will come to us for further comment  The general consensus now is 
that we then refer them to EFET

Jan

Please  see below a summary of the journalists who will be returning this 
weekend from their trip to California courtesy of Ruhrgas 

Up to you now to send them the EFET position paper on California  Would 
suggest you try to get it on their desk by Monday morning latest if 
possible  Would also send it to those who have refused to go and other key 
contacts we have given to you  Media seems to be keen to know EFETs 
position on this  Let me know if you need translation of the personalised 
note that will accompany the position paper Obviously we will divert any 
requests we get to you Will get their email addresses to you later so you 
can email it to them rather than fax it with the possibility they will get it 
too late 

Good luck

Subject journalists in California


Eva

Ive finished my guerillaPRjob here are the results

Ruhrgas has invited the NordrheinWestfalen region where Essen is located
based correspondents of the national dailies and also the energy
journalists of the most important business magazines

Journalists in Califonia
Werner Sturbeck FAZ  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
Werner Jaspert Sddeutsche Zeitung
Dr Jrgen Frech WAZ  Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung
Jochen Schuster Focus

Journalists that had been invited but refused
Dr Andreas Wildhagen Wirtschaftswoche
HansWilly Bein Financial Times Deutschland
Die Welt

I also got the information that Ruhrgas held a press conference yesterday
in California So we can expect the first articles on California tomorrow
or latest on Monday I also will do an additional internet monitoring for
example WAZ which we dont read daily this afternoon to see if there are
already some articles

We should recommend EFET to send their statement not only to those
journalists who have been on the press trip but to all key contacts Most of
the journalists I spoke to or colleagues from the newsdesk seem to be keen to
know what EFET has to say about the California issue

Please let me know if you need further information

		 Subject FERCs marketing affiliate conference

Becky and I attended FERCs gas marketing affiliate conference last week  
Nonaffiliated competitors continue to build straw men and describe abuses 
with no real evidence to back them up the funny money argument and capacity 
hoarding are two examples  The funny money argument assumes marketing 
affiliates will bid above market rates for capacity because they excess 
payment is going to the corporate bottom line  Hoarding capacity to drive up 
price  may be an issue but it is not a marketing affiliate issue as anyone 
can do it FERC staff did not seem terribly sympathetic to the points made 
but at least one FERC staffer seemed to believe that one solution would be to 
require the pipelines to offer capacity in smaller blocks to let smaller 
entities put together bids  FERC also indicated they were in fact auditing 
compliance but in a nonpublic way

There were some concerns voiced which I agree with and there is an 
opportunity to file additional comments on Apr   I would like to put the 
following in these comments

Evidence of affiliate abuse preference is just not there  The best folks can 
do is make up stuff
We welcome FERC monitoring if that is needed to bring confidence to the 
marketplace that abuse is not occurring  But the issue is really whether we 
do have a crisis of confidence or merely a bunch of disgruntled competitors 
who are just seeking to neutralize the affiliated competitors
The FERC rules and the information reported with a caveat under those rules 
are adequate for detection and enforcement and deterrence
That said the definition of marketing affiliate should be expanded to 
include affiliated electric generators who are siting plants along affiliate 
pipelines
The pipeline  reporting and internet systems should allow users to 
download and manipulate transportation related data which is not currently 
the case

We also need to address a deal on Northern where ENA took capacity at a 
discount albeit after other parties had an opportunity to match our bid  
This was a deal brought up in the conference

Let me know how this sounds Thanks

Friends

The statute should be reviewed by whichever lawyer is supporting the project 

 As I mentioned to Alice Weekley I am unfamiliar with the recent amendments 
referenced requiring the notice for projects that do not actually cross 
reservation property The amendment does not surprise me though 

 In the past for example during the Transwestern expansion in  we 
developed a comprehensive NAGPRA plan with tribes whose reservations we 
crossed yet neighboring tribes were includedthe thinking by the various 
State Historic Preservation officers was that unearthed remains bones 
funerial objects pottery pieces holy objects etc may have belonged to 
tribes other than those from whose reservation they were ultimately 
unearthed  It made for a VERY VERY long and complicated plan and 
consultation processnot only when objects were unearthed but simply 
putting the required anticipatory plan and procedures in place PRIOR to 
construction  It gives me a chuckle my late husband Leonard Hilton who 
was in charge of the TW project is likely rolling in his own grave at the 
mere thought of Enron having to put another of these plans 
togetherHaha   As I said Ive not read the amendment  but hopefully it 
only legally requires noticeyet in my nearly  years of practicing 
law Ive rarely seen  a notice that didnt crack the door or sound the 
alarm of further buerocratic opportunity

For your further information I have met Billie Ray Cypress personally and 
hes a decent and seemingly reasonable guy with a huge casino on the rez  
yet these personal attributes frequently go by the wayside when it comes to 
perceived economic opportunity  
 Chief James Billiechief of the Seminoles nd largest nd wealthiest tribe 
in North America on the other hand is shrewd in business dictitorial in 
management and personally  has an ego bigger than Texas behavior to match 
and is proud of it which makes him a ton of fun to be with if he likes 
youhe wrestles alligators writes rock and roll and playsin whatever 
stage opportunity is presented himas long as he can be the center of 
attention  The Seminoles have not only a tribal web site James Billie has 
his own  Check it outits a hoot  He has been chief for about  years 
and Im guessing hes maybe in his early s  The Seminoles have 
recognized significant economic development under James but he is definitely 
a My way or the highway kind of guyhe loves you hates you or ignores 
youand he has a tribal council that is respectfully terrified of him If 
any activity smacks of anything James Billie doesnt like hell know no 
limits in stopping itremember this guy wrestles alligators No Joke

I dont recognize the other names on the list but I think its clear from 
both the beurocratic issues as well as the specific tribal issues incident 
to each affected tribe everything associated with the process should be 
executed with all of this in mind  Id be happy to speak with the projects 
lawyer to discuss this further if information beyond that set forth above 
would be helpful

Thanks

Christie

Ginger  please forward this to all of GA  Thanks

This is a request for help from my colleagues in GA  I am preparing Enrons 
comments to the Federal Trade Commission concerning the results of different 
regulatory approaches by states implementing retail electric competition 
programs or legislation  The FTC has invited comments on a number of 
specific issues but their goal is to examine various state retail 
competition programs and describe those features that have resulted in 
consumer benefits and those that have not yielded consumer benefits  

There are some obvious areas where well comment  California  but Id 
appreciate people sending me specific examples of good or bad regulatory 
policies in other states   Also does anyone know of any good reports or 
analyses already prepared on these issues   Thanks  Bob

Subject Red Herring Article


Jeff

I was recently skimming the Enron news articles on Yahoo Finance and saw this 
one published in Red Herring about the sad demise of the renewable energy 
business in California

http  wwwredherringcom indexasplayoutstorydocidchannel


I thought the article was reasonable until I got to a certain part about the 
impact that recent high prices have had on these companies and Enron was 
mentioned in a rather improper light in my opinion  Below is a short 
excerpt from the article with a particular sentence highlighted concerning 
Enron

Proponents of renewable power viewed Californias deregulation as flawed 
from the onset three years ago Still they anticipated that with adequate 
publicity millions of consumers could be persuaded to switch from the 
traditional power supply which comes mainly from the more polluting fossil 
fuels and nuclear power and that the demand would spur supply The number of 
producers and retailers getting into the green market would then only grow  
as long as the big utilities didnt interfere

Thats what almost happened Over the last three years retailers like Green 
Mountain Energy and Utilitycom bought green power already available in 
California and started to invest in building their own renewable energy 
generators like windmill farms and large solarpanel assemblies Still for 
all the optimism and effort only about  customers  less than  
percent of the  million households that had the option of switching 
providers  chose to support them Many of those were swayed by a 
deregulationmandated credit of  cents per kilowatt hour for consumers who 
switched When natural gas prices were high the credit actually represented 
a real savings Historically environmentally conscious consumers have paid a 
penny or two more per kilowatt hour for renewable energy along with an 
average monthly surcharge of 

Then last fall the fledgling industry started to crumble Energy 
wholesalers like Enron NYSE ENE and Calpine NYSE CPN responded to a 
rising demand for energy by raising their prices from  cents per kilowatt 
hour to as much as  Green retailers had trouble getting credit to buy 
power Many chose to drop out of the market rather than have to charge a 
price that was less than their cost When the energy crisis hit many green 
consumers bills more than doubled

In light of the recent email that was sent out I thought that I would bring 
this to your attention as it may warrant a response to bring clarity that 
Enron does not raise prices it transacts in a market where prices are set by 
supply and demand  The average person reading this could very easily come to 
the conclusion that Calpine and Enron broke the back of the renewable energy 
companies which is clearly not the case  Nonetheless thought you might 
find this of interest

Attached is the proposed Stip to allow PJM to move forward as an RTO

In the Stip we argue that PJM should be approved by FERC but condition our 
acceptance on a FERC process to unify the Northeast markets

My only comment is to delete the final WHEREAS paragraph on congestion 
management  

While our ability to later stop PJM from being an RTO is limited I believe 
that this gives us the ability to drive a consolidation of the Northeast 
markets  which is one of the goals of the East Power desk

In addition I think that the overall direction of PJM in commercializing its 
software is a good activity for our interest  even if we dont want 
everything in their package

this w  our energy star award and we have GREAT environmental messaging   
Wed like to highlight this announcement on Earth Day April nd

The facilities folks are interested in switching from Reliant to EES for 
actual commodity  It makes sense to work strategically together on winwin 
proposal that will not only make sense economically but that we can use in 
our messaging  The focus of the meeting is to discuss the various proposals 
and steps for moving forward

Observations on the California Electricity Crisis
White House Writers Group
January  

Will the last business to leave California please turn out the lights
Oh wait theyre already out

California Governor Gray Davis may ultimately prove responsible for the 
dimming of more lights than Frank Sinatra music

California has done for energy deregulation what Florida has done for 
elections

California Governor Gray Davis says hell appoint a power plant czar to 
help solve the states energy crisis  There must be a sign on his desk 
saying The buck stops herejust long enough for me to pass it to someone 
else

During the current energy crisis in California the spotlight shines on 
Governor Gray Davisso long as its not knocked out by rolling blackouts 
that is

Gray Davis was shocked when told about the doomsday scenario  Not the one 
from Pacific Gas  Electric which envisions California power blackouts 
lasting  hours a day the one from his aides saying he might lose the 
governors race in 

California politicians have learned what thieves have known for a longtime  
Its easier to pick someones pocket in the dark

California is talking conservation  One good conservation measure would be 
for Governor Gray Davis to save his breath trying to convince people that 
government control is the answer to the energy crisis


Possible Jingle Themes for Gray Davis Reelection Bid

My Hopes Were High til the Lights Went Low

Brother Can You Spare a Megawatt

Top  Reasons to Not Have California Government Electricity

  Promise of efficient electricity gives politicians one more thing to lie 
about

  Power keeps going off when Rush Limbaugh comes on air

  Light bulbs would match politicians for dimness

  Special tax on flashlights

  Fifteen day waiting period to use microwave

  Rolling blackouts joined by rolling the taxpayers

Observations on the California Energy Crisis
The White House Writers Group
January st



Gray Davis has announced that he will soon announce two energy czars to lead 
the state through the current crisis  Logical candidates include Laurel and 
Hardy Abbott and Costello Beavis and Butthead and Siegfried and Roy

The environmentalist Green Party is wellnamed  Thanks to its role in 
blocking construction of new power plants Californians are forking over 
plenty of green for energy

Californias power industry is very Kennedyesque  Their message to consumers 
is Ask not what your energy company can do for you ask what you can do for 
your energy company

Congress might get involved in Californias energy crisis  Theres nothing a 
drowning victim needs more than having an anchor thrown to him

Its one thing for California politicians trying to solve the energy problem 
to go back to the drawing board but do they have to ask taxpayers to buy 
them a new one

In California lawmakers are now getting down to details  The latest debate 
involves what to name the bonds the state will issue to help bail out the 
utilities  Proposals on the table include  Blackout BondsBailout Bonds 
Davis Debts Blunder Bonds Fiasco Funds

Comparing Enron to Apples

You may have noticed  or you may be asking why  industry analysts often 
compare Enron to Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs or investment banks 
like Chase Manhattan  We thought it was time to sort out any confusion 
between our businesses just in case someone asks you to explain  Heres how 
were different from those guys
w Enron provides physical delivery of energy products to customers  we are 
not just traders  Those guys mainly act as brokers and do not participate 
physically
w Enron proactively seeks to reform and create markets  Those guys simply 
participate and compete
w Enron extends its business model into new and deregulating markets 
enabling high growth rates  Those guys are in markets that generate less 
aggressive growth rates
w Enron owns physical assets that provide consistent cash flow such as our 
pipelines  Those guys do not have them

And if thats not enough we think our employees are so much cooler than 
theirs

Subject Re Downtown Arena HHCC asked to give public comments to 
Construction Committee this week  

Steve

I dont want to get caught in a crossfire here so I thought your group could 
give me some guidance  

I think the referendum is very important for the city and will help us 
continue to show Houston as a significant metropolitan area  I am not 
convinced that the ultimate form of the deal for minority participation in 
Enron Field was in fact what was intended  In that agreement Aramark owns 
all of the concessions but has a  profit share with minorities  My 
understanding is that there are no minority owned businesses in that deal

I would like to communicate this sentiment but I would also certainly like 
to reinforce Enrons position

Thanks
Mark

Subject Downtown Arena HHCC asked to give public comments to Construction 
Committee this week


Dear Board Member

As you may already know we have been working with the Harris CountyHouston
Sports Authority to have included in their agreement with the Houston
Rockets a  minority participation goal in the design construction and
operation of a downtown basketball arena  This is the same commitment that
we received from the Rockets in   We received a commitment from the
sports authority and the mayors office that the minority participation goal
of  will be included in the contract  We have met with Celena Garza and
communicated with Al Luna our interests and they have expressed their
support for our position  We have also asked Sen Mario Gallegos for his
support and received it

We are in the process of confirming that our language calling for such goal
has been included in the final document and that Al Luna and Celena Garza
are sufficiently satisfied with the language which will be voted on later
this week

Once confirmed Sonny Flores Chairman of the Economic Development Committee
has recommended to Massey that the Chamber be prepared to offer some sort of
public statement in support or not supporting a referendum to build the
arena  We have been asked to address the Construction Committee of the
sports authority by Billy Burge and Wayne Smith  Sonny has indicated that
once we have a confirmation from Al and Celena our interests should be
sufficiently covered and that supporting the referendum would be good for
Hispanic businesses

Massey has asked that I poll the board for its input and get a majority
commitment from the board so as to move forward in offering support or no
support for the referendum  Ordinarily this would be discussed and
considered at a meeting of the Board of Directors however since the sports
authority posted its meeting notice  hours prior to meeting and is ready
to proceed with its approval of the Letter Agreement with the Houston
Rockets we are seeking input in this manner

I am attaching a copy of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Chamber
and the Sports Authority for you review  There have been no revisions to
the last copy that was circulated at the past Executive Committee meeting at
Tony Grijalvas office

Massey has asked that you respond with your input suggestions and position
for or not for the chamber offering its support for the arena via email
within  hours of this notice  The chambers position will be determined
by the majority of those respondents to this email by no later than 
pm CDT on Wednesday August

Thanks for the info on the California Energy Crisis

Message

I would like to take the time to say Thank You for the descriptive email 
on the
California crisis It was very informative and it was also good to know what 
Enrons part
in all of this was 

Just a quick Thanks and also I personally would like to see more 
informative
communications similar to this about Enrons role in various situations 
around the world 

I think its good for other people like me who do not have a thorough 
knowledge of the
energy markets in the world to get these types of emails They are very 
insightful and
give me knowledge on how the business runs"

Nels make the call to Lundquist just to find out what his status is what he 
might look for when his current assignment is over etc  obviously without

		 Subject Andrew Lundquist

I got your message about Andrew  He would be an excellent catch  However I 
see a couple of significant problems  My guess is that Andrew is too senior 
for this position particularly after having chaired the Cheney task force  
Also I would not anticipate that he would be available for several months 
if then  We should fill this position immediately  We are already missing 
opportunities because this position is vacant 

As for our search using Korn Ferry I have narrowed the field to two very 
good candidates   I am setting up time for Rick to interview these 
candidates next Monday  The first candidate is Drew Maloney with Rep Tom 
Delays office  Drew would give us enormous visibility in House Republican 
leadership circles seems trustworthy and capable of learning most of the 
substance of the energy portfolio  Drew has strong networking skills which 
I think would nicely fit with Toms strategic and technical skills  The 
second candidate is John Shelk whom I have known for nearly  years  John 
was the lead Republican staff on the House Energy and Commerce Committee 
under Norm Lent  John left the Committee in   Since then John has 
worked in the financial services and gaming industries where he has enhanced 
his political and Republican networking skills  John in very short order 
would have extremely strong technical skills atlhough he has been away from 
the industry for eight years  I believe both candidates bring different but 
very strong talents to the job  I have a second opening for an enviromental 
advocate  I am discussing with Rick the possibility of whether we could 
redirect one of these candidates probably John to that slot   That said 
please let me know if I should have Nels pursue Andrew

Subject Economic Espionage Act Presentation  August th


You are cordially invited to attend a presentation entitled  Acquiring 
Information Trade Secrets and the Economic Espionage Act EEA   Daniel 
Waltz of the law firm Patton Boggs LLP is a leading expert on the EEA and 
will deliver what promises to be an interesting and informative segment  
Congress passed the EEA in  and it will increasingly shape how corporate 
America collects uses and protects valued information  In addition to 
explaining some of the intricacies of the EEA Dan Waltz will include 
hypothetical corporate case studies some actually torn from the headlines 
to illustrate his points

This event is sponsored by ENAs Competitive Analysis and Business Controls 
CABC group and is supported by ENA legal   This event kicksoff CABCs 
Competitive Intelligence Standards Program which seeks to raise awareness of 
issues relevant both to Enrons practitioners and senior consumers of 
competitive intelligence  This particular speaking engagement is designed to 
raise awareness of the EEAs legal guidelines as well as to stimulate 
thought both on the collection opportunities against our competitors as well 
as how we might better protect Enrons own proprietary information   I 
believe the topic of the EEA is especially relevant given that we find 
ourselves amidst the big bang of this new information age  

All CABC staff is being asked to attend this presentation and we are 
inviting a small number of other Enron employees who are engaged in aspects 
of serious competitive intelligence  Select executives like yourselves are 
being invited to attend and I would welcome any suggestions of others that 
you think might benefit from attending this event  

The EEA presentation is set for August   PM in the th floor 
Conference room  Please RSVP to either myself or Sharon Purswell  Hope to 
see you there


 
PS  By the way our next speaker segment in the CI Standards Program will 
concentrate on the guidelines and implications of the Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act FCPA and will likely be scheduled for the fall

Steve we briefly discussed last Tuesday the possibility of using Mr Lays 
contact with the Chairman of Toyota Mr Okuda to assist us in securing a 
senior executive from Toyota to speak at the May  conference in Tokyo  

We agreed that I should draft a letter for Jeff Skilling to send to Mr Okuda 
I have had a rethink and believe that as a matter of courtesy Japanese 
style it would be preferable in the first instance if the contact with Mr 
Okuda is done from chairman to chairman Mr Lays letter will serve as an 
introduction to Jeff Skilling and will also permit Enron Japan to follow up 
directly with Mr Okudas staff in Japan We can then draft a letter for Jeff 
Skilling to confirm arrangements

I attach a draft letter for that purpose If the revised approach is in 
order I will liaise on the matter with Rosalee and Sherri with a copy to 
you

2001-03-12T01:00:00-08:00,"As to whether long term contracting by Cal is a good idea the answer is 
somewhat mixed  We were one of the early parties pointing out the problems 
with total reliance on the spot market and encouraging more forward 
contracting  Given the utilities precarious financial position there were 
two options  outsource the default provider obligation to the market this 
is what we prefer but there was no political support for it or  have the 
state put its credit behind the purchases  California is pursuing the 
latter with CDWR prucahsing the utilities requirements  In the short term 
we have criticized the states plan because it contemplates state takeover of 
the grid state participation in power plant financing construction and 
ownership and they have not made it clear that CDWR really has the money to 
pay for all the purchases  I am attaching text I have used as the base for a 
number of communications with policymakers

Hi Steve  Long time no talk  I hope you are well  I KNOW you are busy  I
just have a couple of matters for your attention

  We as part of a group of Northwest IOUS are exploring the possibility of
retaining former Montana Governor Racicot to work BPA issues on our behalf 
PGE will continue with Mike Andrews as our lobbyist but Racicot would work for
the IOUs as a group  Does this cause you any concerns  Incidentally we may
step up our efforts somewhat in the general area of BPA because of the
situation out here  Please let me know if I or Mike should be coordinating
what we do with any of your folks in DC

  One of the major Northwest issues is who will be the next BPA
Administrator  For a variety of reasons there really arent any good
candidates from the Northwest and were probably all to close to the situation
anyway  I was wondering if the Enron net could come up with any good ideas
for someone with good energy and policy experience from outside the Northwest
 Someone who would appeal to the Bush administration  

  With the delay in closing our sale to Sierra we would very much like the
ability to use Enron Online for trading  I believe we can get the regulatory
approvals necessary but apparently when we raised this some months ago there
was strong opposition from within Enron particularly Joe Hartsoe  Do you see
an issue with pursuing this  How do you suggest I move this forward

Thanks Steve  As you may hear from time to time things are going well here
in Oregon  We are proceeding on our restructuring which is beginning to get
notice from NARUC and others as a possible model for states that have not yet
proceeded  Its an interesting world  I look forward to hearing from you

ie a role commensurate with our level of interest  I have talked with John

Cuts Seeks Help Of  Small Firms

WASHINGTON  Angry and confused that a Republican administration has 
targeted one of their favorite programs for big cuts Americas largest 
exporters are appealing for help from lawmakers 
Boeing Co Caterpillar Inc Enron Corp Halliburton Co and others are 
launching an aggressive lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill to protect the 
ExportImport Bank from budget reductions the White House labels the ExIm 
Bank as corporate welfare
The administration has fired its shot and now were firing ours said 
Edmund B Rice president of the Coalition for Employment Through Exports an 
industry group that is leading the effort 
Since they got wind of the proposed cuts a few weeks ago business lobbyists 
have been trying to rally sympathetic lawmakers And executives at Boeing 
Caterpillar and other big companies plan to contact some  smaller 
suppliers that benefit indirectly from the  billion of export loans 
guarantees and insurance that ExIm Bank provided in the last fiscal year 
Those small companies the executives hope will create a groundswell of 
support in Congress for the ExIm Bank 
Companies large and small who have similar interests here are banding 
together to provide an educational effort so people understand the impact of 
this said Chris Hansen Boeing senior vice president for government 
relations 
Corporate lobbyists also have dug up a speech that Vice President Dick 
Cheney while chief executive of Halliburton gave in  praising the bank 
and scoffing at those who consider it a giveaway to big business They plan 
to pass Mr Cheneys comments to influential members of Congress this week 
Well be circulating them very broadly Mr Rice said 
A spokeswoman for Mr Cheney had no immediate comment 
ExIm Bank officials arent talking publicly avoiding the appearance that 
they are battling the White House to overturn the proposed  cut in the 
banks  million operating budget for the current fiscal year which ends 
Sept  But an ExIm official said the topic has come up in conversations 
between key lawmakers and ExIm Bank Chairman James A Harmon who is soon to 
be succeeded by Mel Sembler a Bush campaign fundraiser and a 
shoppingcenter developer 
At first business lobbyists assumed administration budgeteers were just 
looking for savings anywhere they could find it Before President Bush 
released his spending plan last week companies appealed to Mitchell Daniels 
head of the White House budget office in an attempt to keep the ExIm Bank 
cuts out of the final proposal 
The ExIm Banks corporate clients include some of the countrys largest 
political contributors Boeing the banks largest user received  
billion of financing last year The Seattle aerospace company and its 
employees contributed  million to politicians and parties during the  
election cycle  to Republicans according to federal election data 
assembled by the Center for Responsive Politics Caterpillar a Peoria Ill 
maker of engines and heavy equipment that secured seven ExIm Bank deals last 
year and its employees contributed more than    to Republicans 
Company officials deny they wanted to leverage donations to try to secure 
political support for the ExIm Bank 
Many lobbyists have come to the conclusion that administration officials  
those of a libertarian persuasion  oppose ExIm Bank as a form of welfare 
for corporations Indeed the White House budget plan criticized the banks 
operations as unjustified public subsidies for companies That makes it a 
much more serious issue Mr Rice said Were concerned that the 
administration seems to be turning its attention in this direction 
Barring intervention from Mr Cheney business groups now have largely given 
up hope of convincing the White House to back down planning instead to use 
their muscle to convince Congress to restore the ExIm Banks funding Bank 
officials and US companies argue that far from being a subsidy the bank 
simply allows American companies to compete with European and Japanese firms 
that receive assistance from their own governments 
In many markets in Asia and Africa the bank is absolutely critical to our 
ability to sell Americanmade products said Bill Lane Caterpillars

Dutch Gas Competition Grows Despite Sluggish Reforms
By Germana Canzi
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

  
Dow Jones Energy Service
Copyright c  Dow Jones  Company Inc

LONDON Dow Jones The Netherlands is emerging as an important testing 
ground for EU gas liberalization as new trading hubs for competitive 
shortterm gas supplies from the UK and Norway emerge on the Belgian and 
German borders 
However much remains to be done A group of large energy users and traders 
is preparing to confront Gasunie Thursday in a hearing organized by the 
regulator The main issues of contention are the balancing system which 
Gasunie conducts on an hourly basis the extent to which transport tariffs 
are costfocused and thirdparty access to storage facilities
The emergence of competition in the Dutch gas sector is mostly due to the 
initiative of new market entrants who despite a difficult regulatory 
environment have managed to develop a market for shortterm gas virtually 
from scratch 
If liquidity improves in these emerging hubs the Netherlands could become an 
important transit country for freely tradeable gas supplies to other 
countries in northwest Europe as well as being an important market in its 
own right However the difficulty of implementing transparent thirdparty 
access systems in the Netherlands and in neighboring Germany casts a dark 
cloud over recent progress in competition 
Since December Enron Europe Ltd UENE Duke Energy Corp DUK EOn AG 
EON RWE AG GRWE and Electrabel SA BELE have been actively buying and 
selling gas sourced in the UK the Netherlands and Norway in a number of 
hubs between Emden in Germany and Emshaven and Oude Statenzijl in the 
Netherlands 
David Gallagher head of European gas trading at Enron in London estimates 
that at least one trade a day of around  therms for a quarterly 
contract is done at the Oude Statenzijl hub where the Gasunie pipeline 
system connects to the network of Wingas GmbH 
An important element kickstarting shortterm trading was the sale in 
December  of a  billion cubic meter a year Norwegian gas supply 
contract to five Dutchbased power generators 
Robert van der Hoeven head of fuel procurement at Electrabel the owner of 
Dutch generator EPON said his company uses most of the gas it imports from 
Norway for its plants in the Netherlands and trades the rest on a shortterm 
basis in the OudeEmden area This pattern is common to the other Dutchbased 
parties to that contract 
Trading in Dutch hubs received a further boost when Nederlandse Gasunie NV 
NNEG decided after months of wrangling with regulator DTe to lower its 
transport tariffs by  from January  and to unbundle its combined 
commodity and service tariff the socalled CSS system from July  
Gasunie now claims its pipeline system is fully open and transparent To 
prove this it says it has lost  of its customers in the eligible market 
but that figure hasnt changed much since March  Small wonder that 
critics say the switching figure doesnt necessarily indicate an ideal system 
of thirdparty access 
According to energy consultants The Brattle Group around half of the gas 
used by alternative suppliers goes through the  bcm year Zebra pipeline from 
Zelzate to Zeeland which was built by Dutch utilities a few years ago 
precisely because Gasunie refused to provide access on favorable terms 
Shippers have complained that the hourly system used by Gasunie to balance 
the pipeline system raises the overall cost of shipping through its network 
significantly Gasunie imposes a balancing charge which effectively forces 
shippers to pay for the extra gas brought into the system from storage sites 
in addition to the capacity and transmission price Critics say Gasunie has 
so far failed to unbundle these charges although it agreed to do so in 
January 
According to the Brattle Group another controversial aspect of Gasunies 
tariff system is that it is based on theoretical costs of constructing new 
pipelines rather than its actual costs 
The DTe is also considering ways of reforming the storage system to make it 
competitive BP PLC UBP and Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij NV operate 
storage facilities and lease capacity to Gasunie through longterm contracts 
The regulator is studying ways of allowing third parties access to storage 
facilities Gasunie has so far shown little sign of negotiating more 
competitive tariffs with storage operators and passing on the benefits to 
customers critics say 
The growth of shortterm trading in the Dutch gas market is also inevitably 
linked to its potential as a transit country for gas coming from the 
UKBelgium gas interconnector and going towards the bcmayear German 
market 
Market participants say liquidity at the Emden and Oude hubs has grown 
considerably since EOn and RWE started trading there earlier this year 
However the obstructive attitude of incumbents toward thirdparty access 
there has meant that so far most gas traded in the Netherlands has remained 
there

Deal with state could take until  to close
By LESLIE GORNSTEIN
AP Business Writer

  
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright  The Associated Press All Rights Reserved

LOS ANGELES AP  A tentative deal aimed at rescuing Southern California 
Edison from insolvency might not close in time to prevent the utility from 
begging creditors for more patience Edison officials said Tuesday 
The utilitys tentative  billion agreement to sell its power lines to 
the state could take until  to be consummated thanks to complicated 
legal issues and other paperwork an Edison official told bondholders Tuesday
Once the deal is signed Edison will try to borrow against the promised cash 
but Edison International Chief Financial Officer Ted Craver admitted the 
utility might have to ask creditors to simply wait for their money until it 
has the  billion in hand 
Energy suppliers owed money by Edison did not immediately return calls for 
comment Tuesday 
At least four groups of suppliers have sued Edison for millions in unpaid 
bills going back months Edison and fellow utility Pacific Gas  Electric 
have said they have lost  billion on the open power market thanks to 
soaring prices paired with stateimposed price caps 
PGEs parent company was able to recently borrow  billion to pay its 
stockholders and its debuts It did not use any of that money to pay PGEs 
bills 
Edisons disclosure meanwhile shocked state officials 
Steve Maviglio spokesman for Gov Gray Davis initially declined to comment 
on the status of the Edison deal but eventually said regarding its closure 
Were optimistic it will be sooner rather than later 
The pacing would have nothing to do with whether fellow utilities Sempra 
Energy and PGE also sell their transmission lines to California Craver 
said 
Among the things that could delay the deals closing is Edisons need to find 
landowners on whose property its lines were built to assure no legal 
agreements are being violated by the sale Edison would also have to pin down 
exactly what it would be selling to the state  terms that might not be 
decided until after a deal has been inked Craver said 
Trust me Craver said in a phone call after the conference There are a 
lot of legaltype documents  stuff that you and I  would think of as a 
bloody nightmare 
The disclosure comes at a time when an increasing number of power suppliers 
are suing the utility for millions in unpaid bills 
Edison also disclosed Tuesday that two more lawsuits had landed in its lap  
one by a group of windpowered generators including Enron Wind the other by 
two suppliers including New Yorkbased Caithness Energy 
Both suits were filed during the past five days Edison Assistant General 
Counsel Barbara Reeves said It was not immediately clear how much the 
complainants were seeking neither Enron nor Caithness returned calls for 
comment 
The two filings bring the total number of suits by renewableenergy suppliers 
against Edison to four the utility said The city of Long Beach and 
CalEnergy Operating Group a geothermal supplier have also sued for back 
payments 
CalEnergy alone has said it is owed  million in November and December 
payments 
The line sale part of a multifaceted tentative deal with the state that 
could save Edison from insolvency could take anywhere from several months 
into next year Craver said 
The tentative deal announced by Gov Gray Davis Feb  calls for the state 
to pay more than twice the book value for Edisons lines 
It also would require Edison to sell cheap power to the state for a decade 
and for Edison to end its lawsuit against state regulators The suit asserts 
that price caps imposed by the California Public Utilities Commission are 
illegal under federal law 
Additionally Edisons parent would have to return  million it collected 
from the utility over the past several years The money was used to pay debt 
buy back stock and pay dividends to investors 
SCE PGE and Sempra have complained they are near bankruptcy because of 
soaring prices on the open market combined with the stateimposed price caps 
for consumers 
Sempra and PGE have yet to announce similar linesale deals with the state 
though they and the governor have said negotiations are ongoing The total 
cost of the  miles of lines has been estimated at  billion to  
billion

Sierra Pacific CEO Doubts SEC OK Of Enron Unit BuyReport

  
Dow Jones Energy Service
Copyright c  Dow Jones  Company Inc

LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Sierra Pacific Resources SRP CEO Walter Higgins 
said in an interview last week that he doubts the companys  billion 
acquisition of Enron Corps ENE utility Portland General Electric will be 
approved by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission the Las Vegas Sun 
reported Tuesday 
The SEC must find that Sierra Pacific is in a strong financial position 
before it will approve the deal but the company is currently weakened by 
having lost millions of dollars in fuel and purchased power costs Higgins 
said in the report
A  million rate increase to cover those costs began March  but Higgins 
said that money would only pay back those expenses and wouldnt improve the 
companys stability to a level the SEC would find adequate according to the 
report 
The Public Utilities Commission can halt the rate hike and order refunds if 
it decides the hike isnt necessary The PUC is holding hearings to determine 
the prudency of the hike and members of the states powerful casino and 
mining industries have filed to intervene 
Sierra Pacifics plan to shore up its financial position through the sale of 
its  power plants worth nearly  billion may also be in jeopardy The 
state Senate is considering a bill to block the sales and Nevada Gov Kenny 
Guinn recently sent a letter to the PUC asking that it reconsider its order 
allowing electric utilities to sell assets 
Financial analysts have said that not allowing Sierra Pacifics two utilities 
to sell their assets would have a ripple effect on the companys financial 
position The asset sales are tied to lowpriced power contracts and if the 
sales are canceled the lowpriced power will be gone as well 
If the divestiture is stoppedthe state may be dealing with a much bigger 
rate increase Steve Fleishman Merrill Lynch utility analyst told Dow 
Jones Newswires recently 
Sierra Pacific is the parent company of electric utilities Sierra Pacific 
Power Co and Nevada Power which serve customers in the states North and

Many Power Deals Announced by California Governor Still Not Final
By Jason Leopold

  
Dow Jones Business News
Copyright c  Dow Jones  Company Inc

Dow Jones Newswires 
LOS ANGELES  Many of the longterm powersupply contracts announced by 
California Gov Gray Davis this week remain under negotiation or are the 
subject of ongoing lawsuits power suppliers said Tuesday
The lack of finality to the deals raises questions about the states success 
in covering its power needs particularly going into what is expected to be 
an unusually tight summer 
Generators said privately they were surprised the governor went ahead with 
his announcement Monday given that many of the contracts havent been 
signed 
David Freeman general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power who negotiated the contracts on behalf of the state conceded that 
details remain to be worked out This is not a done deal Mr Freeman said 
adding that credit concerns are keeping generators from signing the deals 
Gov Davis announced Monday that California has secured  longterm 
contracts that will provide California with about  million megawatt hours 
of electricity over  years at a price of more than  billion A megawatt 
hour is roughly the amount of electricity needed to power  homes 
Several of those forward deals however involve contracts originally held by 
Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison and PGE Corp 
PCG unit Pacific Gas  Electric at the California Power Exchange 
previously the states main power market 
The governor seized those contracts earlier this year just before the Power 
Exchange liquidated them to cover hundreds of millions of dollars in power 
bills the utilities had failed to pay 
The contracts which total about  million megawatt hours of electricity 
and have a market value of about  billion according to market sources 
have yet to be paid for or signed over to the state Duke Energy Corp DUK 
one of the suppliers that sold the contracts to Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed has 
sued Gov Davis for unlawfully commandeering those contracts 
Although Duke has reached an interim settlement to continue providing power 
to the state Department of Water Resources until April  the company and 
the Davis administration still have to develop a comprehensive longterm 
settlement to pay for the power supply contracts said Duke spokesman Tom 
Williams 
The governor went ahead with the announcement because the California 
Department of Water Resources believes it will be able to finalize and sign 
the contracts over the next several weeks Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio 
said 
Separately several suppliers named in the governors announcement Monday  
including Duke Reliant Energy Inc REI Mirant Corp MIR Sempra Energy 
Enron Corp ENE and Avista Corp AVA  said they have yet to sign final 
agreements with the state although negotiations were ongoing 
We are working in good faith with the DWR toward a longterm contract said 
Art Larson spokesman for Sempra Energy Resources a unit of Sempra Mr 
Larson said Sempra signed a terms of agreement with the waterresources 
department and expects to reach a final agreement over the next several 
weeks 
Reliant said it has only signed a shortterm contract with the state that 
expires in about two weeks The company will only sign a longterm contract 
once its paid more than  million owed by Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed 
spokesman Richard Wheatley said 
Mirant said it also wont sign contracts with the state until its paid 
Enron said its reached agreement on terms with the state but has some 
creditrelated details to hammer out Everythings been agreed to except for 
some credit technicalities Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said 
Meanwhile small independent power plants in California that are capable of 
generating  megawatts of power are shut down because their owners 
havent been paid by the states two main utilities the California 
Independent System Operator said Tuesday 
The decline in smallplant output has contributed to the states powersupply 
problems the past two months Partnerships involving El Paso Corp EPG for 
example shut down  megawatts of generation last weekend due to 
nonpayment the company said Tuesday 
SoCal Ed hasnt paid the owners of the smaller generators known as 
qualifying facilities since early December which means the generators are 
still owed for electric production in October while PGE has paid only a 
small percentage of its qualifying facility bills since its last full payment 
in early January 
The plants onethird of which are powered by renewable sources like wind and 
solar power meet almost  of Californias electricity needs Almost all of 
the closed generators are fueled by natural gas and many havent been able 
to pay their gas suppliers and have been cut off from their gas supply 
The California Senate Energy Committee plans to vote on legislation to create 
a new pricing system for all qualifying facilities this week The proposed 
bill would cut the prices to qualifying facilities from about  cents a 
kilowatthour the past eight months to about eight cents depending on the 
price of fiveyear naturalgas contracts the generators can sign The plants 
that run on renewable resources would be paid  cents a kilowatthour

Do you think your Govt Affairs group could do some investigation for us on 
what the states are doing concerning strengthening the current equal pay 
laws  Also the Paycheck Fairness Act S was introduced in the US 
Senate on January   and referred to the Committee on Health 
Education Labor and Pensions  Sponsors Mr Daschle Ms Mikulski Mr 
Kennedy Mr Harkin Mr Wellstone Ms Landrieu Mrs Lincoln Mr Akaka 
Mr Breaux Mr Cleland Mr Durbin Mr Inouye Mr Kerry Mr Leahy Mr 
Reid Mr Sarbanes Mr Schumer and Mr Johnson  Added after the bill was 
introducedMr Torricelli Mrs Murray Mrs Boxer Mr Dodd Mrs 
Clinton Mr Feingold  It appears that this proposed act has some reporting 
requirements that could be very burdensome for usit would probably make us 
have to rethink how we have our compensation system structured  Could 
someone in your group get a feel for what is happening with this in 
Washington and what kind of support it is getting

Campaign To Enact Comparable Worth Legislation Launched In  States 
Numerous Others Introducing Legislation

On February  a number of state legislators labor organizations and policy 
advocates launched a campaign to promote state legislation that would 
strengthen current equal pay laws and encourage comparable worth pay systems 
   Although  states have been explicitly identified as targets for the 
passage of such  legislation a number of other states have already 
introduced bills to further address wage discrimination 

Proponents of the campaign maintain that current national and state laws that 
mandate equal pay for equal work do not go far enough to remedy past and 
current discrimination in compensation  Therefore they claim government 
intervention is necessary to raise womens or minorities wages and eliminate 
gender and racebased wage discrimination 

State legislators are considering varying proposals to remedy wage 
disparities including commissioning pay equity studies increasing 
penalties for violations of current equal pay laws or implementing mandated 
job evaluation and comparison comparable worth pay systems to raise wages 
for jobs that are traditionally dominated by women or minorities 

The following states have been identified as targets of this legislation  
For those states that have already seen legislation introduced the bill 
numbers are also included 

Alabama
Arizona Senate Bill 
Colorado SB 
Connecticut
Georgia SR 
Massachusetts HB 
New Mexico
Nevada
Ohio
Texas HB  House Bill  provides an employee who files a wage claim with 
legal protection from retaliation 
 Wisconsin
 West Virginia

Other states not included in the campaign are also seeking wage 
discrimination legislation 

Indiana HB  
Iowa HB  HB  
Minnesota HB  SB   
Missouri HB  
Mississippi HB  SB both died 
New York AB  SB public sector employees affected only 
Pennsylvania HB  
Rhode Island SB  
Wyoming HB passed Senate Feb

WASHINGTON  Angry and confused that a Republican administration has 
targeted one of their favorite programs for big cuts Americas largest 
exporters are appealing for help from lawmakers 
Boeing Co Caterpillar Inc Enron Corp Halliburton Co and others are 
launching an aggressive lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill to protect the 
ExportImport Bank from budget reductions the White House labels the ExIm 
Bank as corporate welfare
The administration has fired its shot and now were firing ours said 
Edmund B Rice president of the Coalition for Employment Through Exports an 
industry group that is leading the effort 
Since they got wind of the proposed cuts a few weeks ago business lobbyists 
have been trying to rally sympathetic lawmakers And executives at Boeing 
Caterpillar and other big companies plan to contact some  smaller 
suppliers that benefit indirectly from the  billion of export loans 
guarantees and insurance that ExIm Bank provided in the last fiscal year 
Those small companies the executives hope will create a groundswell of 
support in Congress for the ExIm Bank 
Companies large and small who have similar interests here are banding 
together to provide an educational effort so people understand the impact of 
this said Chris Hansen Boeing senior vice president for government 
relations 
Corporate lobbyists also have dug up a speech that Vice President Dick 
Cheney while chief executive of Halliburton gave in  praising the bank 
and scoffing at those who consider it a giveaway to big business They plan 
to pass Mr Cheneys comments to influential members of Congress this week 
Well be circulating them very broadly Mr Rice said 
A spokeswoman for Mr Cheney had no immediate comment 
ExIm Bank officials arent talking publicly avoiding the appearance that 
they are battling the White House to overturn the proposed  cut in the 
banks  million operating budget for the current fiscal year which ends 
Sept  But an ExIm official said the topic has come up in conversations 
between key lawmakers and ExIm Bank Chairman James A Harmon who is soon to 
be succeeded by Mel Sembler a Bush campaign fundraiser and a 
shoppingcenter developer 
At first business lobbyists assumed administration budgeteers were just 
looking for savings anywhere they could find it Before President Bush 
released his spending plan last week companies appealed to Mitchell Daniels 
head of the White House budget office in an attempt to keep the ExIm Bank 
cuts out of the final proposal 
The ExIm Banks corporate clients include some of the countrys largest 
political contributors Boeing the banks largest user received  
billion of financing last year The Seattle aerospace company and its 
employees contributed  million to politicians and parties during the  
election cycle  to Republicans according to federal election data 
assembled by the Center for Responsive Politics Caterpillar a Peoria Ill 
maker of engines and heavy equipment that secured seven ExIm Bank deals last 
year and its employees contributed more than    to Republicans 
Company officials deny they wanted to leverage donations to try to secure 
political support for the ExIm Bank 
Many lobbyists have come to the conclusion that administration officials  
those of a libertarian persuasion  oppose ExIm Bank as a form of welfare 
for corporations Indeed the White House budget plan criticized the banks 
operations as unjustified public subsidies for companies That makes it a 
much more serious issue Mr Rice said Were concerned that the 
administration seems to be turning its attention in this direction 
Barring intervention from Mr Cheney business groups now have largely given 
up hope of convincing the White House to back down planning instead to use 
their muscle to convince Congress to restore the ExIm Banks funding Bank 
officials and US companies argue that far from being a subsidy the bank 
simply allows American companies to compete with European and Japanese firms 
that receive assistance from their own governments 
In many markets in Asia and Africa the bank is absolutely critical to our 
ability to sell Americanmade products said Bill Lane Caterpillars

Dutch Gas Competition Grows Despite Sluggish Reforms
By Germana Canzi
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

  
Dow Jones Energy Service
Copyright c  Dow Jones  Company Inc

LONDON Dow Jones The Netherlands is emerging as an important testing 
ground for EU gas liberalization as new trading hubs for competitive 
shortterm gas supplies from the UK and Norway emerge on the Belgian and 
German borders 
However much remains to be done A group of large energy users and traders 
is preparing to confront Gasunie Thursday in a hearing organized by the 
regulator The main issues of contention are the balancing system which 
Gasunie conducts on an hourly basis the extent to which transport tariffs 
are costfocused and thirdparty access to storage facilities
The emergence of competition in the Dutch gas sector is mostly due to the 
initiative of new market entrants who despite a difficult regulatory 
environment have managed to develop a market for shortterm gas virtually 
from scratch 
If liquidity improves in these emerging hubs the Netherlands could become an 
important transit country for freely tradeable gas supplies to other 
countries in northwest Europe as well as being an important market in its 
own right However the difficulty of implementing transparent thirdparty 
access systems in the Netherlands and in neighboring Germany casts a dark 
cloud over recent progress in competition 
Since December Enron Europe Ltd UENE Duke Energy Corp DUK EOn AG 
EON RWE AG GRWE and Electrabel SA BELE have been actively buying and 
selling gas sourced in the UK the Netherlands and Norway in a number of 
hubs between Emden in Germany and Emshaven and Oude Statenzijl in the 
Netherlands 
David Gallagher head of European gas trading at Enron in London estimates 
that at least one trade a day of around  therms for a quarterly 
contract is done at the Oude Statenzijl hub where the Gasunie pipeline 
system connects to the network of Wingas GmbH 
An important element kickstarting shortterm trading was the sale in 
December  of a  billion cubic meter a year Norwegian gas supply 
contract to five Dutchbased power generators 
Robert van der Hoeven head of fuel procurement at Electrabel the owner of 
Dutch generator EPON said his company uses most of the gas it imports from 
Norway for its plants in the Netherlands and trades the rest on a shortterm 
basis in the OudeEmden area This pattern is common to the other Dutchbased 
parties to that contract 
Trading in Dutch hubs received a further boost when Nederlandse Gasunie NV 
NNEG decided after months of wrangling with regulator DTe to lower its 
transport tariffs by  from January  and to unbundle its combined 
commodity and service tariff the socalled CSS system from July  
Gasunie now claims its pipeline system is fully open and transparent To 
prove this it says it has lost  of its customers in the eligible market 
but that figure hasnt changed much since March  Small wonder that 
critics say the switching figure doesnt necessarily indicate an ideal system 
of thirdparty access 
According to energy consultants The Brattle Group around half of the gas 
used by alternative suppliers goes through the  bcm year Zebra pipeline from 
Zelzate to Zeeland which was built by Dutch utilities a few years ago 
precisely because Gasunie refused to provide access on favorable terms 
Shippers have complained that the hourly system used by Gasunie to balance 
the pipeline system raises the overall cost of shipping through its network 
significantly Gasunie imposes a balancing charge which effectively forces 
shippers to pay for the extra gas brought into the system from storage sites 
in addition to the capacity and transmission price Critics say Gasunie has 
so far failed to unbundle these charges although it agreed to do so in 
January 
According to the Brattle Group another controversial aspect of Gasunies 
tariff system is that it is based on theoretical costs of constructing new 
pipelines rather than its actual costs 
The DTe is also considering ways of reforming the storage system to make it 
competitive BP PLC UBP and Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij NV operate 
storage facilities and lease capacity to Gasunie through longterm contracts 
The regulator is studying ways of allowing third parties access to storage 
facilities Gasunie has so far shown little sign of negotiating more 
competitive tariffs with storage operators and passing on the benefits to 
customers critics say 
The growth of shortterm trading in the Dutch gas market is also inevitably 
linked to its potential as a transit country for gas coming from the 
UKBelgium gas interconnector and going towards the bcmayear German 
market 
Market participants say liquidity at the Emden and Oude hubs has grown 
considerably since EOn and RWE started trading there earlier this year 
However the obstructive attitude of incumbents toward thirdparty access 
there has meant that so far most gas traded in the Netherlands has remained 
there

Deal with state could take until  to close

LOS ANGELES AP  A tentative deal aimed at rescuing Southern California 
Edison from insolvency might not close in time to prevent the utility from 
begging creditors for more patience Edison officials said Tuesday 
The utilitys tentative  billion agreement to sell its power lines to 
the state could take until  to be consummated thanks to complicated 
legal issues and other paperwork an Edison official told bondholders Tuesday
Once the deal is signed Edison will try to borrow against the promised cash 
but Edison International Chief Financial Officer Ted Craver admitted the 
utility might have to ask creditors to simply wait for their money until it 
has the  billion in hand 
Energy suppliers owed money by Edison did not immediately return calls for 
comment Tuesday 
At least four groups of suppliers have sued Edison for millions in unpaid 
bills going back months Edison and fellow utility Pacific Gas  Electric 
have said they have lost  billion on the open power market thanks to 
soaring prices paired with stateimposed price caps 
PGEs parent company was able to recently borrow  billion to pay its 
stockholders and its debuts It did not use any of that money to pay PGEs 
bills 
Edisons disclosure meanwhile shocked state officials 
Steve Maviglio spokesman for Gov Gray Davis initially declined to comment 
on the status of the Edison deal but eventually said regarding its closure 
Were optimistic it will be sooner rather than later 
The pacing would have nothing to do with whether fellow utilities Sempra 
Energy and PGE also sell their transmission lines to California Craver 
said 
Among the things that could delay the deals closing is Edisons need to find 
landowners on whose property its lines were built to assure no legal 
agreements are being violated by the sale Edison would also have to pin down 
exactly what it would be selling to the state  terms that might not be 
decided until after a deal has been inked Craver said 
Trust me Craver said in a phone call after the conference There are a 
lot of legaltype documents  stuff that you and I  would think of as a 
bloody nightmare 
The disclosure comes at a time when an increasing number of power suppliers 
are suing the utility for millions in unpaid bills 
Edison also disclosed Tuesday that two more lawsuits had landed in its lap  
one by a group of windpowered generators including Enron Wind the other by 
two suppliers including New Yorkbased Caithness Energy 
Both suits were filed during the past five days Edison Assistant General 
Counsel Barbara Reeves said It was not immediately clear how much the 
complainants were seeking neither Enron nor Caithness returned calls for 
comment 
The two filings bring the total number of suits by renewableenergy suppliers 
against Edison to four the utility said The city of Long Beach and 
CalEnergy Operating Group a geothermal supplier have also sued for back 
payments 
CalEnergy alone has said it is owed  million in November and December 
payments 
The line sale part of a multifaceted tentative deal with the state that 
could save Edison from insolvency could take anywhere from several months 
into next year Craver said 
The tentative deal announced by Gov Gray Davis Feb  calls for the state 
to pay more than twice the book value for Edisons lines 
It also would require Edison to sell cheap power to the state for a decade 
and for Edison to end its lawsuit against state regulators The suit asserts 
that price caps imposed by the California Public Utilities Commission are 
illegal under federal law 
Additionally Edisons parent would have to return  million it collected 
from the utility over the past several years The money was used to pay debt 
buy back stock and pay dividends to investors 
SCE PGE and Sempra have complained they are near bankruptcy because of 
soaring prices on the open market combined with the stateimposed price caps 
for consumers 
Sempra and PGE have yet to announce similar linesale deals with the state 
though they and the governor have said negotiations are ongoing The total 
cost of the  miles of lines has been estimated at  billion to  
billion

Sierra Pacific CEO Doubts SEC OK Of Enron Unit BuyReport

LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Sierra Pacific Resources SRP CEO Walter Higgins 
said in an interview last week that he doubts the companys  billion 
acquisition of Enron Corps ENE utility Portland General Electric will be 
approved by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission the Las Vegas Sun 
reported Tuesday 
The SEC must find that Sierra Pacific is in a strong financial position 
before it will approve the deal but the company is currently weakened by 
having lost millions of dollars in fuel and purchased power costs Higgins 
said in the report
A  million rate increase to cover those costs began March  but Higgins 
said that money would only pay back those expenses and wouldnt improve the 
companys stability to a level the SEC would find adequate according to the 
report 
The Public Utilities Commission can halt the rate hike and order refunds if 
it decides the hike isnt necessary The PUC is holding hearings to determine 
the prudency of the hike and members of the states powerful casino and 
mining industries have filed to intervene 
Sierra Pacifics plan to shore up its financial position through the sale of 
its  power plants worth nearly  billion may also be in jeopardy The 
state Senate is considering a bill to block the sales and Nevada Gov Kenny 
Guinn recently sent a letter to the PUC asking that it reconsider its order 
allowing electric utilities to sell assets 
Financial analysts have said that not allowing Sierra Pacifics two utilities 
to sell their assets would have a ripple effect on the companys financial 
position The asset sales are tied to lowpriced power contracts and if the 
sales are canceled the lowpriced power will be gone as well 
If the divestiture is stoppedthe state may be dealing with a much bigger 
rate increase Steve Fleishman Merrill Lynch utility analyst told Dow 
Jones Newswires recently 
Sierra Pacific is the parent company of electric utilities Sierra Pacific 
Power Co and Nevada Power which serve customers in the states North and 
South respectively

Many Power Deals Announced by California Governor Still Not Final
By Jason Leopold

  
Dow Jones Business News
Copyright c  Dow Jones  Company Inc

Dow Jones Newswires 
LOS ANGELES  Many of the longterm powersupply contracts announced by 
California Gov Gray Davis this week remain under negotiation or are the 
subject of ongoing lawsuits power suppliers said Tuesday
The lack of finality to the deals raises questions about the states success 
in covering its power needs particularly going into what is expected to be 
an unusually tight summer 
Generators said privately they were surprised the governor went ahead with 
his announcement Monday given that many of the contracts havent been 
signed 
David Freeman general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power who negotiated the contracts on behalf of the state conceded that 
details remain to be worked out This is not a done deal Mr Freeman said 
adding that credit concerns are keeping generators from signing the deals 
Gov Davis announced Monday that California has secured  longterm 
contracts that will provide California with about  million megawatt hours 
of electricity over  years at a price of more than  billion A megawatt 
hour is roughly the amount of electricity needed to power  homes 
Several of those forward deals however involve contracts originally held by 
Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison and PGE Corp 
PCG unit Pacific Gas  Electric at the California Power Exchange 
previously the states main power market 
The governor seized those contracts earlier this year just before the Power 
Exchange liquidated them to cover hundreds of millions of dollars in power 
bills the utilities had failed to pay 
The contracts which total about  million megawatt hours of electricity 
and have a market value of about  billion according to market sources 
have yet to be paid for or signed over to the state Duke Energy Corp DUK 
one of the suppliers that sold the contracts to Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed has 
sued Gov Davis for unlawfully commandeering those contracts 
Although Duke has reached an interim settlement to continue providing power 
to the state Department of Water Resources until April  the company and 
the Davis administration still have to develop a comprehensive longterm 
settlement to pay for the power supply contracts said Duke spokesman Tom 
Williams 
The governor went ahead with the announcement because the California 
Department of Water Resources believes it will be able to finalize and sign 
the contracts over the next several weeks Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio 
said 
Separately several suppliers named in the governors announcement Monday  
including Duke Reliant Energy Inc REI Mirant Corp MIR Sempra Energy 
Enron Corp ENE and Avista Corp AVA  said they have yet to sign final 
agreements with the state although negotiations were ongoing 
We are working in good faith with the DWR toward a longterm contract said 
Art Larson spokesman for Sempra Energy Resources a unit of Sempra Mr 
Larson said Sempra signed a terms of agreement with the waterresources 
department and expects to reach a final agreement over the next several 
weeks 
Reliant said it has only signed a shortterm contract with the state that 
expires in about two weeks The company will only sign a longterm contract 
once its paid more than  million owed by Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed 
spokesman Richard Wheatley said 
Mirant said it also wont sign contracts with the state until its paid 
Enron said its reached agreement on terms with the state but has some 
creditrelated details to hammer out Everythings been agreed to except for 
some credit technicalities Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said 
Meanwhile small independent power plants in California that are capable of 
generating  megawatts of power are shut down because their owners 
havent been paid by the states two main utilities the California 
Independent System Operator said Tuesday 
The decline in smallplant output has contributed to the states powersupply 
problems the past two months Partnerships involving El Paso Corp EPG for 
example shut down  megawatts of generation last weekend due to 
nonpayment the company said Tuesday 
SoCal Ed hasnt paid the owners of the smaller generators known as 
qualifying facilities since early December which means the generators are 
still owed for electric production in October while PGE has paid only a 
small percentage of its qualifying facility bills since its last full payment 
in early January 
The plants onethird of which are powered by renewable sources like wind and 
solar power meet almost  of Californias electricity needs Almost all of 
the closed generators are fueled by natural gas and many havent been able 
to pay their gas suppliers and have been cut off from their gas supply 
The California Senate Energy Committee plans to vote on legislation to create 
a new pricing system for all qualifying facilities this week The proposed 
bill would cut the prices to qualifying facilities from about  cents a 
kilowatthour the past eight months to about eight cents depending on the 
price of fiveyear naturalgas contracts the generators can sign The plants 
that run on renewable resources would be paid  cents a kilowatthour

HOUSTON Dow Jones US natural gas physical prices fell Tuesday as demand 
eased except in the Northeast and Southeast areas of the country traders 
said 
Heavy snowstorms in the upper Northeast supported some pricing as did cooler 
weather in Georgia the Carolinas and the Florida panhandle
Some storage buying occurred in Texas if they could make it work a trader 
said 
It was a pretty uneventful day a Gulf Coast trader said late Tuesday 
Also because of the snowstorm in the Northeast traders had purchased gas 
ahead of time to make up for needed load he said 
A scheduled work outage on Enrons Transwestern San Juan lateral in New 
Mexico was completed and the return of a power plant in California 
alleviated demand in the West traders said 
At the ArizonaCalifornia border hub buyers paid around  a million 
British thermal units West Coast traders said down as much as  from 
Monday 
At PGE Citygate prices were mixed with buyers paying  MMBtu 
down  cents on the bid up  cents on the offer 
In the Midwest Chicago Citygate prices fell  cents cents to a range of 
 MMBtu Alliance Pipeline into Chicago traded around

The Nymex April natural gas futures contract settled at  MMBtu down 
 cents in a tight rangebound uneventful session that started late due 
to bad weather 
Physical gas prices at the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana ended in a 
range of  MMBtu down  cents cents from Monday 
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line at Station  deals were made in a similar 
range of  MMBtu down  cents on the bid unchanged on the offer

WASHINGTON  Angry and confused that a Republican administration has 
targeted one of their favorite programs for big cuts Americas largest 
exporters are appealing for help from lawmakers 
Boeing Co Caterpillar Inc Enron Corp Halliburton Co and others are 
launching an aggressive lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill to protect the 
ExportImport Bank from budget reductions the White House labels the ExIm 
Bank as corporate welfare
The administration has fired its shot and now were firing ours said 
Edmund B Rice president of the Coalition for Employment Through Exports an 
industry group that is leading the effort 
Since they got wind of the proposed cuts a few weeks ago business lobbyists 
have been trying to rally sympathetic lawmakers And executives at Boeing 
Caterpillar and other big companies plan to contact some  smaller 
suppliers that benefit indirectly from the  billion of export loans 
guarantees and insurance that ExIm Bank provided in the last fiscal year 
Those small companies the executives hope will create a groundswell of 
support in Congress for the ExIm Bank 
Companies large and small who have similar interests here are banding 
together to provide an educational effort so people understand the impact of 
this said Chris Hansen Boeing senior vice president for government 
relations 
Corporate lobbyists also have dug up a speech that Vice President Dick 
Cheney while chief executive of Halliburton gave in  praising the bank 
and scoffing at those who consider it a giveaway to big business They plan 
to pass Mr Cheneys comments to influential members of Congress this week 
Well be circulating them very broadly Mr Rice said 
A spokeswoman for Mr Cheney had no immediate comment 
ExIm Bank officials arent talking publicly avoiding the appearance that 
they are battling the White House to overturn the proposed  cut in the 
banks  million operating budget for the current fiscal year which ends 
Sept  But an ExIm official said the topic has come up in conversations 
between key lawmakers and ExIm Bank Chairman James A Harmon who is soon to 
be succeeded by Mel Sembler a Bush campaign fundraiser and a 
shoppingcenter developer 
At first business lobbyists assumed administration budgeteers were just 
looking for savings anywhere they could find it Before President Bush 
released his spending plan last week companies appealed to Mitchell Daniels 
head of the White House budget office in an attempt to keep the ExIm Bank 
cuts out of the final proposal 
The ExIm Banks corporate clients include some of the countrys largest 
political contributors Boeing the banks largest user received  
billion of financing last year The Seattle aerospace company and its 
employees contributed  million to politicians and parties during the  
election cycle  to Republicans according to federal election data 
assembled by the Center for Responsive Politics Caterpillar a Peoria Ill 
maker of engines and heavy equipment that secured seven ExIm Bank deals last 
year and its employees contributed more than    to Republicans 
Company officials deny they wanted to leverage donations to try to secure 
political support for the ExIm Bank 
Many lobbyists have come to the conclusion that administration officials  
those of a libertarian persuasion  oppose ExIm Bank as a form of welfare 
for corporations Indeed the White House budget plan criticized the banks 
operations as unjustified public subsidies for companies That makes it a 
much more serious issue Mr Rice said Were concerned that the 
administration seems to be turning its attention in this direction 
Barring intervention from Mr Cheney business groups now have largely given 
up hope of convincing the White House to back down planning instead to use 
their muscle to convince Congress to restore the ExIm Banks funding Bank 
officials and US companies argue that far from being a subsidy the bank 
simply allows American companies to compete with European and Japanese firms 
that receive assistance from their own governments 
In many markets in Asia and Africa the bank is absolutely critical to our 
ability to sell Americanmade products said Bill Lane Caterpillars

Dutch Gas Competition Grows Despite Sluggish Reforms
By Germana Canzi
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

  
Dow Jones Energy Service
Copyright c  Dow Jones  Company Inc

LONDON Dow Jones The Netherlands is emerging as an important testing 
ground for EU gas liberalization as new trading hubs for competitive 
shortterm gas supplies from the UK and Norway emerge on the Belgian and 
German borders 
However much remains to be done A group of large energy users and traders 
is preparing to confront Gasunie Thursday in a hearing organized by the 
regulator The main issues of contention are the balancing system which 
Gasunie conducts on an hourly basis the extent to which transport tariffs 
are costfocused and thirdparty access to storage facilities
The emergence of competition in the Dutch gas sector is mostly due to the 
initiative of new market entrants who despite a difficult regulatory 
environment have managed to develop a market for shortterm gas virtually 
from scratch 
If liquidity improves in these emerging hubs the Netherlands could become an 
important transit country for freely tradeable gas supplies to other 
countries in northwest Europe as well as being an important market in its 
own right However the difficulty of implementing transparent thirdparty 
access systems in the Netherlands and in neighboring Germany casts a dark 
cloud over recent progress in competition 
Since December Enron Europe Ltd UENE Duke Energy Corp DUK EOn AG 
EON RWE AG GRWE and Electrabel SA BELE have been actively buying and 
selling gas sourced in the UK the Netherlands and Norway in a number of 
hubs between Emden in Germany and Emshaven and Oude Statenzijl in the 
Netherlands 
David Gallagher head of European gas trading at Enron in London estimates 
that at least one trade a day of around  therms for a quarterly 
contract is done at the Oude Statenzijl hub where the Gasunie pipeline 
system connects to the network of Wingas GmbH 
An important element kickstarting shortterm trading was the sale in 
December  of a  billion cubic meter a year Norwegian gas supply 
contract to five Dutchbased power generators 
Robert van der Hoeven head of fuel procurement at Electrabel the owner of 
Dutch generator EPON said his company uses most of the gas it imports from 
Norway for its plants in the Netherlands and trades the rest on a shortterm 
basis in the OudeEmden area This pattern is common to the other Dutchbased 
parties to that contract 
Trading in Dutch hubs received a further boost when Nederlandse Gasunie NV 
NNEG decided after months of wrangling with regulator DTe to lower its 
transport tariffs by  from January  and to unbundle its combined 
commodity and service tariff the socalled CSS system from July  
Gasunie now claims its pipeline system is fully open and transparent To 
prove this it says it has lost  of its customers in the eligible market 
but that figure hasnt changed much since March  Small wonder that 
critics say the switching figure doesnt necessarily indicate an ideal system 
of thirdparty access 
According to energy consultants The Brattle Group around half of the gas 
used by alternative suppliers goes through the  bcm year Zebra pipeline from 
Zelzate to Zeeland which was built by Dutch utilities a few years ago 
precisely because Gasunie refused to provide access on favorable terms 
Shippers have complained that the hourly system used by Gasunie to balance 
the pipeline system raises the overall cost of shipping through its network 
significantly Gasunie imposes a balancing charge which effectively forces 
shippers to pay for the extra gas brought into the system from storage sites 
in addition to the capacity and transmission price Critics say Gasunie has 
so far failed to unbundle these charges although it agreed to do so in 
January 
According to the Brattle Group another controversial aspect of Gasunies 
tariff system is that it is based on theoretical costs of constructing new 
pipelines rather than its actual costs 
The DTe is also considering ways of reforming the storage system to make it 
competitive BP PLC UBP and Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij NV operate 
storage facilities and lease capacity to Gasunie through longterm contracts 
The regulator is studying ways of allowing third parties access to storage 
facilities Gasunie has so far shown little sign of negotiating more 
competitive tariffs with storage operators and passing on the benefits to 
customers critics say 
The growth of shortterm trading in the Dutch gas market is also inevitably 
linked to its potential as a transit country for gas coming from the 
UKBelgium gas interconnector and going towards the bcmayear German 
market 
Market participants say liquidity at the Emden and Oude hubs has grown 
considerably since EOn and RWE started trading there earlier this year 
However the obstructive attitude of incumbents toward thirdparty access 
there has meant that so far most gas traded in the Netherlands has remained 
there

LOS ANGELES AP  A tentative deal aimed at rescuing Southern California 
Edison from insolvency might not close in time to prevent the utility from 
begging creditors for more patience Edison officials said Tuesday 
The utilitys tentative  billion agreement to sell its power lines to 
the state could take until  to be consummated thanks to complicated 
legal issues and other paperwork an Edison official told bondholders Tuesday
Once the deal is signed Edison will try to borrow against the promised cash 
but Edison International Chief Financial Officer Ted Craver admitted the 
utility might have to ask creditors to simply wait for their money until it 
has the  billion in hand 
Energy suppliers owed money by Edison did not immediately return calls for 
comment Tuesday 
At least four groups of suppliers have sued Edison for millions in unpaid 
bills going back months Edison and fellow utility Pacific Gas  Electric 
have said they have lost  billion on the open power market thanks to 
soaring prices paired with stateimposed price caps 
PGEs parent company was able to recently borrow  billion to pay its 
stockholders and its debuts It did not use any of that money to pay PGEs 
bills 
Edisons disclosure meanwhile shocked state officials 
Steve Maviglio spokesman for Gov Gray Davis initially declined to comment 
on the status of the Edison deal but eventually said regarding its closure 
Were optimistic it will be sooner rather than later 
The pacing would have nothing to do with whether fellow utilities Sempra 
Energy and PGE also sell their transmission lines to California Craver 
said 
Among the things that could delay the deals closing is Edisons need to find 
landowners on whose property its lines were built to assure no legal 
agreements are being violated by the sale Edison would also have to pin down 
exactly what it would be selling to the state  terms that might not be 
decided until after a deal has been inked Craver said 
Trust me Craver said in a phone call after the conference There are a 
lot of legaltype documents  stuff that you and I  would think of as a 
bloody nightmare 
The disclosure comes at a time when an increasing number of power suppliers 
are suing the utility for millions in unpaid bills 
Edison also disclosed Tuesday that two more lawsuits had landed in its lap  
one by a group of windpowered generators including Enron Wind the other by 
two suppliers including New Yorkbased Caithness Energy 
Both suits were filed during the past five days Edison Assistant General 
Counsel Barbara Reeves said It was not immediately clear how much the 
complainants were seeking neither Enron nor Caithness returned calls for 
comment 
The two filings bring the total number of suits by renewableenergy suppliers 
against Edison to four the utility said The city of Long Beach and 
CalEnergy Operating Group a geothermal supplier have also sued for back 
payments 
CalEnergy alone has said it is owed  million in November and December 
payments 
The line sale part of a multifaceted tentative deal with the state that 
could save Edison from insolvency could take anywhere from several months 
into next year Craver said 
The tentative deal announced by Gov Gray Davis Feb  calls for the state 
to pay more than twice the book value for Edisons lines 
It also would require Edison to sell cheap power to the state for a decade 
and for Edison to end its lawsuit against state regulators The suit asserts 
that price caps imposed by the California Public Utilities Commission are 
illegal under federal law 
Additionally Edisons parent would have to return  million it collected 
from the utility over the past several years The money was used to pay debt 
buy back stock and pay dividends to investors 
SCE PGE and Sempra have complained they are near bankruptcy because of 
soaring prices on the open market combined with the stateimposed price caps 
for consumers 
Sempra and PGE have yet to announce similar linesale deals with the state 
though they and the governor have said negotiations are ongoing The total 
cost of the  miles of lines has been estimated at  billion to  
billion

Sierra Pacific CEO Doubts SEC OK Of Enron Unit BuyReport

  
Dow Jones Energy Service
Copyright c  Dow Jones  Company Inc

LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Sierra Pacific Resources SRP CEO Walter Higgins 
said in an interview last week that he doubts the companys  billion 
acquisition of Enron Corps ENE utility Portland General Electric will be 
approved by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission the Las Vegas Sun 
reported Tuesday 
The SEC must find that Sierra Pacific is in a strong financial position 
before it will approve the deal but the company is currently weakened by 
having lost millions of dollars in fuel and purchased power costs Higgins 
said in the report
A  million rate increase to cover those costs began March  but Higgins 
said that money would only pay back those expenses and wouldnt improve the 
companys stability to a level the SEC would find adequate according to the 
report 
The Public Utilities Commission can halt the rate hike and order refunds if 
it decides the hike isnt necessary The PUC is holding hearings to determine 
the prudency of the hike and members of the states powerful casino and 
mining industries have filed to intervene 
Sierra Pacifics plan to shore up its financial position through the sale of 
its  power plants worth nearly  billion may also be in jeopardy The 
state Senate is considering a bill to block the sales and Nevada Gov Kenny 
Guinn recently sent a letter to the PUC asking that it reconsider its order 
allowing electric utilities to sell assets 
Financial analysts have said that not allowing Sierra Pacifics two utilities 
to sell their assets would have a ripple effect on the companys financial 
position The asset sales are tied to lowpriced power contracts and if the 
sales are canceled the lowpriced power will be gone as well 
If the divestiture is stoppedthe state may be dealing with a much bigger 
rate increase Steve Fleishman Merrill Lynch utility analyst told Dow 
Jones Newswires recently 
Sierra Pacific is the parent company of electric utilities Sierra Pacific 
Power Co and Nevada Power which serve customers in the states North and 
South respectively

Many Power Deals Announced by California Governor Still Not Final
By Jason Leopold

  
Dow Jones Business News
Copyright c  Dow Jones  Company Inc

Dow Jones Newswires 
LOS ANGELES  Many of the longterm powersupply contracts announced by 
California Gov Gray Davis this week remain under negotiation or are the 
subject of ongoing lawsuits power suppliers said Tuesday
The lack of finality to the deals raises questions about the states success 
in covering its power needs particularly going into what is expected to be 
an unusually tight summer 
Generators said privately they were surprised the governor went ahead with 
his announcement Monday given that many of the contracts havent been 
signed 
David Freeman general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power who negotiated the contracts on behalf of the state conceded that 
details remain to be worked out This is not a done deal Mr Freeman said 
adding that credit concerns are keeping generators from signing the deals 
Gov Davis announced Monday that California has secured  longterm 
contracts that will provide California with about  million megawatt hours 
of electricity over  years at a price of more than  billion A megawatt 
hour is roughly the amount of electricity needed to power  homes 
Several of those forward deals however involve contracts originally held by 
Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison and PGE Corp 
PCG unit Pacific Gas  Electric at the California Power Exchange 
previously the states main power market 
The governor seized those contracts earlier this year just before the Power 
Exchange liquidated them to cover hundreds of millions of dollars in power 
bills the utilities had failed to pay 
The contracts which total about  million megawatt hours of electricity 
and have a market value of about  billion according to market sources 
have yet to be paid for or signed over to the state Duke Energy Corp DUK 
one of the suppliers that sold the contracts to Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed has 
sued Gov Davis for unlawfully commandeering those contracts 
Although Duke has reached an interim settlement to continue providing power 
to the state Department of Water Resources until April  the company and 
the Davis administration still have to develop a comprehensive longterm 
settlement to pay for the power supply contracts said Duke spokesman Tom 
Williams 
The governor went ahead with the announcement because the California 
Department of Water Resources believes it will be able to finalize and sign 
the contracts over the next several weeks Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio 
said 
Separately several suppliers named in the governors announcement Monday  
including Duke Reliant Energy Inc REI Mirant Corp MIR Sempra Energy 
Enron Corp ENE and Avista Corp AVA  said they have yet to sign final 
agreements with the state although negotiations were ongoing 
We are working in good faith with the DWR toward a longterm contract said 
Art Larson spokesman for Sempra Energy Resources a unit of Sempra Mr 
Larson said Sempra signed a terms of agreement with the waterresources 
department and expects to reach a final agreement over the next several 
weeks 
Reliant said it has only signed a shortterm contract with the state that 
expires in about two weeks The company will only sign a longterm contract 
once its paid more than  million owed by Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed 
spokesman Richard Wheatley said 
Mirant said it also wont sign contracts with the state until its paid 
Enron said its reached agreement on terms with the state but has some 
creditrelated details to hammer out Everythings been agreed to except for 
some credit technicalities Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said 
Meanwhile small independent power plants in California that are capable of 
generating  megawatts of power are shut down because their owners 
havent been paid by the states two main utilities the California 
Independent System Operator said Tuesday 
The decline in smallplant output has contributed to the states powersupply 
problems the past two months Partnerships involving El Paso Corp EPG for 
example shut down  megawatts of generation last weekend due to 
nonpayment the company said Tuesday 
SoCal Ed hasnt paid the owners of the smaller generators known as 
qualifying facilities since early December which means the generators are 
still owed for electric production in October while PGE has paid only a 
small percentage of its qualifying facility bills since its last full payment 
in early January 
The plants onethird of which are powered by renewable sources like wind and 
solar power meet almost  of Californias electricity needs Almost all of 
the closed generators are fueled by natural gas and many havent been able 
to pay their gas suppliers and have been cut off from their gas supply 
The California Senate Energy Committee plans to vote on legislation to create 
a new pricing system for all qualifying facilities this week The proposed 
bill would cut the prices to qualifying facilities from about  cents a 
kilowatthour the past eight months to about eight cents depending on the 
price of fiveyear naturalgas contracts the generators can sign The plants 
that run on renewable resources would be paid  cents a kilowatthour

Also because of the snowstorm in the Northeast traders had purchased gas 
ahead of time to make up for needed load he said 
A scheduled work outage on Enrons Transwestern San Juan lateral in New 
Mexico was completed and the return of a power plant in California

down  cents on the bid up  cents on the offer

 cents in a tight rangebound uneventful session that started late due 
to bad weather

range of  MMBtu down  cents cents from Monday

Allheres an update on what weve been doing with the Governors  Should I 
be putting Steve Kean on these email updates




As you all know there were several governors events over the past  to  
days in Washington DC

Paul and I met with Steve Reynolds from Wyoming Gov Geringers office  They 
would like us to put forward the name of an Enron individual that could 
participate in an Energy council that is being formed actually commissioned 
by the legislature to study energy issues for the state  Geringer would 
also like to come to Houston to learn about our vision in moving from an 
assets based to a market based entity  

We had contacted Scott Cealy spelling with Arizona Governor Hulls office 
last week and  Paul sat with Gov Hull at the RGA dinner on Monday night and 
had a chance to thank her for her  leadership in opposing price caps Mr 
Cealy left me a voice mail this afternoon basically inviting us to come to 
see them I will schedule that meeting boy that Paul must have been charming 
at dinner

I sat with Gary Smith political guy with Gov Kempthornes office who 
indicated that Kempthorne was scheduled to meet with Vice Pres Cheney on 
Tuesday afternoon  Gov Kitzhaber was also scheduled to attend the meeting 
with Cheney but there was speculation that he may not come  I have not 
confirmed the outcome of that meeting but was invited by Mr Smith to call 
him once they get back to Idaho tommorrow  I will place that call and see 
what I can find out  Mr Racicot was going to get back to us on what he 
found out from Kempthornehas Linda or Rick heard from him  I will be 
continueing outreach with Gary Smith on as routine a basis is acceptable to 
him

We have committed to an RGA event in Aspen Colorado on March  that Governor 
Owens is sponsoring  Paul and I continue to keep in touch with Gov Owens 
staff  As most of you know from previous updates Owens is strong in his 
support against price caps and market based solutions

At our meeting with Racicot on Monday in DC Paul requested some assistance 
from him in setting up a meeting with Kitzhaber  Lindahow do we want to 
follow up on that request

Rick and Paul met with Gov Gary Locke on Tuesday and while they disagreed 
with Lockes position the discussion was civil and at least left the door 
open to future discussions  Rick and Paul will manage this relationship for 
now

We have not has great success in meeting with Leavitt  I will continue to 
work on setting that up  Guinn has also not been extremely receptive to 
meeting with us and Paul and I will look at how whether we continue to knock 
on that door  We are not actively looking to meet with Montana due to some 
commercial reasons

There are a number of other ongoing actions WGA contacts providing info 
etc but the above update should give everybody the highlights

Gentlemen

Situation

Emerson is aggressively seeking at least a three hour time slot for a meeting 
with Jeff Skilling in April or May   Mr Skillings office is hesitant 
to allocate more than two hours without your recommendation  Emerson is 
being persistent

The key players from Emerson are David Farr newly appointed CEO and James 
Berges President and effectively the leader of Emersons strategic 
development effort  It is anticipated that both would attend the meeting

Emerson execs want to i get to know Mr Skilling and other senior 
management ii discuss mutual business opportunities and iii hold a 
discussion about the transformation of Enron from a pipeline company to its 
current form  The last point has to do with Emersons continuing 
selftransformation effort and how Enron achieved its transformation

I need your advice and recommendation  Please respond by email or telephone 
x


Background

Emerson initiated this latest round of contact with Enron in November  
when Mike Train and Mark Proudfoot both Emerson VPs of Corporate 
Development visited the Enron building hosted by Steve Kean  I met them at 
that time

Since that initial meeting Emerson has aggressively pursued a business joint 
venture as preferred supplier with Martin Wenzel and the distributed power 
business I believe with promising results  My sense is that Emerson is 
uniquely positioned as EES partner in that business  I am waiting to 
receive an update from Martin

Emerson is also interested in becoming a preferred supplier for EESs DSM 
business  While we generally support that idea we are pressing Emerson to 
reciprocate by becoming a customer of our bundled outsource business  
Emerson is highly decentralized and our efforts to date have been 
unsuccessful

I want to use the meeting as an opportunity to press Emerson to consider a 
proposal from EESs bundled outsource business

Please let me know your recommendation on this matter

Thanks

Nate

Rob

Thought Id send you the latest draft of the report its   final the 
recommendations are 

Questions the report raises for Enron

Is Enron part of the oil  natural gas sector or the banking and finance 
sector  Both are looking at information sharing mechanism to mitigate risks 
to IT systems  The Banking  Finance sector has been operating an 
information sharing and analysis center ISAC for over a year  Discussions 
with members of the banking and finance sector indicate it has value  

If Enron is a part of the oil  natural gas sector are we willing to take a 
leadership role and enter into a potential LLC with other Council member 
companies to form an ISAC for this sector Cost to Enron would be based on 
number of individuals receiving alerts etc however it could be as low as 
K per year  An additional cost would be to appoint an employee to the 
LLCs governance body to ensure Enrons needs were addressed  Archie Dunham 
CONOCOs Chairman has agreed to champion this initiative if the Council 
recommends it at the  June  meeting

Current coordination

The legal issues have been worked by a subgroup lead by Tom Carmel CONOCO  
Mark Holsworth Corp Legal has been our representative  Recent DOJ action 
regarding information sharing to mitigate IT risks seems to indicate that 
antitrust will not be an issue  Steptoe  Johnson LLP have undertaken a 
review of the liability issues and suggested ways to mitigate them

Mike Hicks and I have been working with Mark Thibodeaux Corp IT Compliance 
and will be meeting with Steve Kean and others in the security and IT 
protection efforts in next two weeks 

Recommendation

Enron participate fully in the oil and natural gas sectors efforts  As 
Enron becomes more and more dependant on IT having a mechanism that provides 
tailored vulnerability information and solutions in a onestopshop format 
is valuable and can lead to reduced insurance premiums

		 Subject RE Dates for Emerson Meeting

Gentlemen

Situation

Emerson is aggressively seeking at least a three hour time slot for a meeting 
with Jeff Skilling in April or May   Mr Skillings office is hesitant 
to allocate more than two hours without your recommendation  Emerson is 
being persistent

The key players from Emerson are David Farr newly appointed CEO and James 
Berges President and effectively the leader of Emersons strategic 
development effort  It is anticipated that both would attend the meeting

Emerson execs want to i get to know Mr Skilling and other senior 
management ii discuss mutual business opportunities and iii hold a 
discussion about the transformation of Enron from a pipeline company to its 
current form  The last point has to do with Emersons continuing 
selftransformation effort and how Enron achieved its transformation

I need your advice and recommendation  Please respond by email or telephone 
x


Background

Emerson initiated this latest round of contact with Enron in November  
when Mike Train and Mark Proudfoot both Emerson VPs of Corporate 
Development visited the Enron building hosted by Steve Kean  I met them at 
that time

Since that initial meeting Emerson has aggressively pursued a business joint 
venture as preferred supplier with Martin Wenzel and the distributed power 
business I believe with promising results  My sense is that Emerson is 
uniquely positioned as EES partner in that business  I am waiting to 
receive an update from Martin

Emerson is also interested in becoming a preferred supplier for EESs DSM 
business  While we generally support that idea we are pressing Emerson to 
reciprocate by becoming a customer of our bundled outsource business  
Emerson is highly decentralized and our efforts to date have been 
unsuccessful

I want to use the meeting as an opportunity to press Emerson to consider a 
proposal from EESs bundled outsource business

Please let me know your recommendation on this matter

Thanks

Nate

Thanks for the note   I have dropped some ideas to Thad to follow up on
during my absence from the office

I am a little nervous about having only two hours   is it possible to get
a larger block of time to get to know each other better and talk through
some of the mutual business opportunities

As we discussed at the last Corporate Responsibility task force meeting one 
activity that we have underway is recruiting an external advisory council  
This council will be comprised of global experts on environmental and social 
issues from nongovernmental organizations and potentially other businesses 
to advise us on trends and issues in this area  An outline of the advisory 
council structure along with categories of experts and proposed names is 
attached below

We expect to convene meetings with this group twice a year inviting the 
Enron executive committee and board of directors as well as the Corporate 
Responsibility task force to engage in a dialogue  We plan to present a

Ken

My name is Chad Tipton  I am currently a Development Support Manager with 
EES in the Integrated Asset Management IAM   Recently I  had the good 
fortune to meet Ron Hosmer  He represents a company called IdleAire 
Technologies Inc  IdleAire is a startup company started in    
IdleAire has developed a system to eliminate truckdrivers from having to idle 
their trucks while on long haul overnight stops  Their plan is to electrify 
truckstops and install remote HVAC units to eliminate truck idling  Also 
these units provide cable TV and internet services  They have already 
piloted the technology in several truckstops in the Knoxville TN area

IdleAires  goal is to 

evolve the nations truck stops and travel centers into the largest 
truck stop electrification network in the world We are taking truck stop 
electrification to the next level Our travel center conversions provide 
heating ventilation and air conditioning HVAC at every parking space We 
also provide drivers incab telephone Internet and television

Idle Air has caught the attention of many interest groups in Washington 
DC  Ron tells me that they have already gained support from Tennessee 
congressmen including Jimmy Duncan and  Van Hilleary   Also former House 
Speaker Newt Gingrich is on the board of directors of IdleAire 
Technologies  These individuals support this technology because it reduces 
emissions and helps state quality for CMAQ funds  

I had mentioned to Ron that I worked for Enron and informed him about what 
we do  He and I both felt that Enron may be interested in developing a 
strategic partnership to take their technology to market   Ron said that 
they are looking for a strategic partner with energy related experience and 
the capital to invest in this project  

Enron would benefit in several ways

  Greater than average returns

  Increased publicity and recognition in Enrons environmental role  EPA 
Energy Star Label EPA Climate Protection Award etc
 
  Increase markets for electricity and possibly gas

  Maintain Enrons title of innovation leader

  Open a whole new market for the energy services group EES  Long term 
maintenance contract commodities etc

  Open a new market for the broadband services group EBS  Videos on 
demand

I believe this opportunity is very synergistic with Enrons business model  
If you would be interested in talking with Ron I would be happy to introduce 
him to you  They have a  very comprehensive business plan that lays out 
their business in detail   I have arranged for him to provide us with an 
executive summary of the business  You can also find out more about the 
company by visiting their website at

Thank you  for your time

Chad Tipton

Energy buyout foes say dump grid plan
Davis critics point to federal veto disclosure 
By Steve Geissinger
SACRAMENTO BUREAU 
SACRAMENTO  Foes of Gov Gray Davis plan to buy power lines said Tuesday 
the thhour disclosure of federal veto power over the stalled deal shows 
the effort should be abandoned altogether 
But Davis who spent the day lobbying federal officials in Washington DC 
said hes confident the Bush administration will support his plan to purchase 
Californias highvoltage transmission grid as part of a deal to rescue 
teetering utilities 
Critics of the plan to ease the energy crisis however arent so sure that 
Bushs Republican administration which favors marketdriven strategies over 
government intervention will support the Democratic governors proposal 
Moreover Republican legislators here said the lastminute revelation that 
the plan would need the approval of federal regulators is further evidence 
that it is misdirected overly complex and will take too long to implement 
It means much more time will be required and time is something that 
especially a lot of the creditors of the utilities do not have said 
Assembly Republican leader Bill Campbell of Villa Park 
I think this means we have to look at an alternative deal Campbell said 
Dan Nelson a spokesman for Senate Republican leader James Brulte of Rancho 
Cucamonga said Republicans generally oppose state purchase of power lines 
from utility companies as part of a plan to rescue them from financial 
difficulty 
They instead support acquisition of some other asset from the utilities such 
as stock warrants in exchange for state assistance with their financial 
woes 
Foes say the grid purchase would saddle the state with an antiquated network 
that could prove costly to maintain while supporters contend it could lead to 
quick improvements in a bottlenecked system overdue for repairs 
Word that Davis plan to buy transmission lines would need federal approval 
surprised some legislators their aides said Open government advocates have 
harshly criticized the administration for secrecy surrounding much of the 
governors energy crisis relief efforts 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Curtis Hebert disclosed 
recently in Washington that his board has authority over the deal which he 
called nationalization that is against the best interests of the American 
public 
Following that disclosure Democratic legislative leaders backing Davis plan 
said they hope to maneuver around the need for commission approval 
California can perhaps circumvent the potential hitch by relying in part on a 
 case involving the state of Nebraska that did not require federal 
approval according to Senate President Pro Tem John Burton DSan Francisco 
Nevertheless Davis in Washington for a national governors meeting said he 
presented a ninepage proposal to US Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham and 
expects a response by the end of the week 
He wants this problem solved and hes been very supportive Davis said 
Hes recommended approval on every request Ive made and I believe he will 
support our proposal 
Abrahams office did not return calls seeking comment 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that will likely weigh the fate of 
the plan however is independent of Abrahams office Even so Abraham is 
part of an energy policy team appointed by Bush and Davis views Abrahams 
support of the proposal as a potential key to a federal nod 
Davis history with the commission wont help his efforts He and the 
commission have been at odds for months over the governors campaign to 
impose tough wholesale price caps in the West 
The latest complications in the plan to rescue utilities came amid a 
continuing deadlock in secret negotiations between the state and the Pacific 
Gas and Electric Co which is reluctant to sell its highvoltage 
transmission lines 
Davis announced Friday that Californias other major investorowned utility 
Southern California Edison had agreed on the basic framework of a deal that 
includes the sale of its transmission grid to the state for  billion 
The utilities trapped between high wholesale costs and lower 
governmentfrozen retail rates have been pushed to the brink of bankruptcy 
as they amassed nearly  billion in debt 
When the utilities could no longer buy enough power the state began 
brokering billions of dollars in emergency and longterm power deals to 
thwart rolling blackouts 
Then Davis and legislators began developing strategies to ease the energy 
crisis including increased conservation construction of new generation 
plants and ways to prevent utility bankruptcies 
Under Davis plan to rescue utilities the state would help fiscally restore 
the companies with bonds in exchange for acquisition of their  miles of 
transmission grids The state would upgrade the aging grid and then lease the 
lines back to the utilities to operate


Energy chief open to plan on transmission line buy out
By Toby Eckert 
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE 
February   

WASHINGTON  Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham is open to Californias plan 
to take over utility transmission lines in the state but stopped short of 
endorsing the proposal saying he needed to study it further Gov Gray Davis 
said yesterday 
From the tone of his remarks I think his comments will be positive and I 
hope by the end of the week he will be able to endorse the proposal or at 
least endorse a modified proposal that is satisfactory to us Davis said 
after meeting with Abraham privately at the Department of Energy 
A spokesman for Abraham said he couldnt characterize Abrahams reaction 
one way or the other But he said Abraham was open to taking a look at the 
material the governor provided and would follow up with Davis 
In his effort to drum up federal support for the buyout plan Davis also 
invoked a name that resonates throughout the halls of power in Washington 
Alan Greenspan 
Davis said the Federal Reserve Board chairman in a general way thinks it 
makes sense to acquire transmission lines to make the capacity improvements 
that have not been done over the past  years 
Greenspan and Davis informally talked about the power crisis this week aides 
to Davis said Greenspans comments could not be confirmed independently 
Davis was in Washington for the fourday winter meeting of the National 
Governors Association But he also used the occasion to try to convince the 
new Bush administration  and the media  that his plans to solve 
Californias power woes are sound 
The governor spent about an hour briefing Abraham on the tentative agreement 
the state struck last week to acquire Southern California Edisons 
transmission system for  billion The state is trying to negotiate 
similar deals with San Diego Gas and Electric and Pacific Gas and Electric as 
a condition for helping the utilities pay off about  billion in debt they 
have accumulated because of soaring wholesale power costs 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission probably will have to sign off on 
any purchase plans and FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert has made comments 
indicating he is skeptical of the idea But Davis believes he can overcome 
possible opposition at FERC if Abraham backs the plans 
Davis also said he and Abraham had some creative talks about how we might be 
able to find more megawatts for this summer and assigned staff members to 
work on that on a daily basis He did not elaborate on the ideas saying 
there may be some details forthcoming in about two to three weeks 
The governor will continue his East Coast sales pitch for the transmission 
line purchase  and other elements of his plan to solve the power crisis  
in a meeting with Wall Street analysts and bondraters today 
Davis and legislators also have pursued longterm power contracts with energy 
suppliers to wean the state from the open market which became wildly 
expensive last year 
Mirant Corp which operates power plants in Northern California said 
yesterday that it has agreed to shift contracts from the defunct California 
Power Exchange to the Department of Water Resources which is the states 
electricity buyer 
The contracts amount to about  megawatts of power over the next  
months Last week Mirant agreed to sell  megawatts to the state next 
month On a typical winter day the maximum demand on the grid managed by the 
state Independent System Operator about  percent of the total state 
network is about  megawatts 
Davis visit to Washington came against the backdrop of a muted federal 
response to Californias power crisis The Bush administration which favors 
open power markets has said it is largely up to state officials to solve the 
problem rejecting calls by Davis for more aggressive action like caps on 
wholesale power costs 
But the Democratic governor praised the Republican president publicly on 
several occasions He cited the administrations temporary extension of 
federal orders that kept electricity and gas flowing to the state during 
emergency shortages and its agreement to speed up federal review of new power 
plants 
Secretary Abraham and the Bush administration in general have been 
wonderfully responsive to my requests I cannot thank them enough Davis 
said yesterday 
Other California Democrats have been less charitable toward President Bush 
I think the president is going in the wrong direction on this issue said 
Rep Bob Filner DSan Diego a staunch advocate of wholesale price controls 
A handsoff approach by the federal government as the president has 
suggested is not going to solve this problem


Energy Experts Belie Davis Rosy Prediction
Summer expected to be crunch time 
Greg Lucas Sacramento Bureau Chief
WednesdayFebruary   
 San Francisco Chronicle 
Sacramento  Gov Gray Davis optimistic assessment that California may be 
on the back side of its energy crisis flies in the face of what many energy 
companies and other experts predict 
Californias real test will come this summer when electricity usage sharply 
increases and unless everything breaks the way Davis hopes predictions are 
that large chunks of the state will be in the dark 
Were not on the back side of this crisis This problem is far far bigger 
than the governor is suggesting said Gary Ackerman executive director for 
the Western Power Trading Forum in Menlo Park 
To characterize the problem that way shows a recklessness that feeds on the 
popular notion we dont have an energy crisis We do We have a very serious 
one thats going to hit us as temperatures and loads go up Ackerman said 
The Democratic governors comments were made Monday in Washington DC 
during an East Coast visit aimed at getting Washington and Wall Street 
support for his energy plan 
He admitted more hard work is needed but said the state is on the back side 
of the crisis because lawmakers have passed bills needed to help lower 
electricity prices 
Does that mean were home free Davis asked yesterday No 
But he again repeated that the state is on the back side of the crisis 
That is contrary to predictions by the Independent System Operator which 
oversees the states power market 
On any given day in June the ISO estimates the state will fall  
megawatts short of demand That would put nearly  million homes in the dark 
if it happens 
In July the expected shortage is  megawatts In August its  
megawatts Thats if California has a normal summer If its hotter than 
normal the shortage grows 
The ISOs estimates tend to be conservative and do not include Davis 
conservation goal 
But even if a  percent reduction were achieved in June that would save 
roughly  megawatts the state would still be short  megawatts 
And there are other variables 
Depending on the snowpack and reservoir levels hydroelectric plants may not 
be able to run at full bore which would also worsen the situation 
That is something the governor cannot spin his way out of said Sen Tom 
McClintock RNorthridge 
Davis said a combination of new power plants and energy conservation will 
help the state get through this summer 
The clock is running The ISO predicts shortages of  megawatts in May  
 just two months away 
The real electricity crisis is going to be this summer and I dont think 
weve made enough progress there said Severin Borenstein director of the 
University of California Energy Institute 
California wont be able to build its way out of the energy crisis by quickly 
approving and building new power plants Borenstein said 
The ISOs demand estimates already factor in the new power plants set to come 
online this summer 
Unless we have a very mild summer and have lots of rainfall between then and 
now Borenstein said we are going to face some serious shortages 
Like Davis Borenstein says California needs to do more to conserve energy 
Unlike Davis he favors raising prices on big power consumers to give them an 
incentive to cut back 
But the Democratic governor may be sending Californians a mixed message 
By telling them the worst is over he could undercut his plan by making 
people believe more conservation is unnecessary 
Excluding what lies ahead there are also plenty of energy issues left 
unresolved right now 
Although Davis has reached a tentative deal with Southern California Edison 
on purchasing its share of the states transmission system for  billion 
 no such deal exists with either Pacific Gas  Electric or San Diego Gas  
Electric 
Some alternative energy producers like cogeneration plants are shutting 
down because the cashpoor utilities havent paid them for several months No 
cash means no fuel to run the turbines that make the juice 
Generators like Duke Energy and Reliant Energy arent convinced the crisis 
has passed 
For starters both companies are owed in excess of  million for 
electricity bought by PGE and Edison but never paid for 
There are a lot of issues still out there such as how much power your state 
will require this summer whether there is enough generation on the ground or 
available commercially to handle the load if there is a significant spike in 
demand said Richard Wheatley a Reliant spokesman 
Harvey Rosenfield head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights 
has a slightly different take on whether the worst is over 
Weve said all along its a crisis inspired by the greed of the utilities 
and the energy companies Rosenfield said 
Now that taxpayers are paying  billion every three weeks to buy 
electricity and the ratepayers are going to pay between  billion and  
billion the companies are happy and the crisis is over What more could they 
want


PUC to mull baseline level for electricity
Its been a decade since amounts were set They vary by region season and 
whether a home is heated with gas or electricity

By Robert T Garrett
The PressEnterprise
SACRAMENTO
Inlandarea residents who want a higher baseline quantity of lowerpriced 
electricity each month will get a chance to plead their case in the next few 
weeks 
The state Public Utilities Commission will examine by early April whether the 
monthly usage limits that trigger higher rates for residential customers are 
set too low PUC President Loretta Lynch said Wednesday 
Baseline amounts are set by the PUC and vary by geographic region season and 
whether a home is heated with gas or electricity 
Its been over a decade since the baselines were set Lynch told the 
Sacramento Press Club    I think its about time for us to look at what 
these baselines are in the st century 
Lynch an appointee of Gov Davis declined to say whether the commission 
will make permanent a percent rate hike imposed in early January on 
residential customers of Southern California Edison which serves much of the 
Inland Empire 
With Edison and Pacific Gas Electric collapsing financially the PUC imposed 
the rate hike  and increases of up to  percent for Edisons large 
business customers  for  days 
The temporary surcharge will be lifted in early April unless the PUC votes 
to keep it in effect 
Davis has said he hopes his plan to rescue the states ailing utilities and 
avoid rolling blackouts can be carried out without further rate hikes 
Davis was in New York City on Wednesday where the plan drew a tepid response 
from Wall Street 
Meanwhile the unexpected shutdown of four Western power plants for repairs 
combined with scheduled maintenance at several instate plants forced 
California grid officials to declare a Stage  alert 
Wall Street analysts who met privately with Davis in New York called his 
moves a good step toward solving the energy crisis but said more must be 
done 
He talked about a lot of shortterm measures to alleviate problems for this 
summer but he hasnt communicated a longterm fix said Lawrence J 
Makovich senior director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates 
Lynch said Wednesday that she and others on the PUC should have recognized 
sooner that utility deregulation wasnt working 
As part of its review of the January rate hikes the PUC will invite public 
comments on baselines Lynch said 
She said she plans to examine the baselines for each climate zone In 
Edisons service area for instance there are six 
Lynch also said the PUC would look at whether baselines are fair and 
effective and whether similar incentives to conserve energy should be built 
into the rates of businesses 
If the commission adopts incentives for businesses she said it has to 
make sure it doesnt set the baseline quantities too low for industrial 
sectors such as agriculture and biotechnology State Sen Jim Battin RLa 
Quinta said Lynchs proposed review of the fairness of baselines in the 
different climate zones could be encouraging 
But he said he thinks businesses will oppose having baselines applied to 
them 
Battin has waged a battle against baselines which he calls social 
engineering and which were mandated by a state law passed in the s 
In the Inland area the baseline system works like this 
In Temecula and Corona an allelectric home  meaning one that is heated 
by electricity  this summer will pay  cents a kilowatt for the first  
kilowatts used each month for each additional kilowatt consumed Edison will 
charge  cents 
In Moreno Valley Hemet Rialto and most of Redlands owners of 
allelectric homes will pay Edison the lower rate for  kilowatts per 
month this summer 
In the Coachella Valley in both summer and winter Edison charges the 
higher cent rate only for monthly consumption above  kilowatts 
Those with gas heating in their homes get different baseline allowances than 
do those with electric heating

State Calpine sign  billion in pacts 
March   
Calpine Corp a San Josebased power plant owner signed two contracts 
valued at up to  billion to sell electricity to the California Department 
of Water Resources for  to  years 
The contracts with the DWR which buys electricity for the states 
twobiggest utilities will provide  megawatts or enough to light  
million homes the company said 
Calpine signed one  billion year contract to sell  megawatts 
from new power plants Deliveries are expected to begin July  with  
megawatts The full amount of power wont be available until July  
A  billion contract calls for Calpine to provide power for  years 
Deliveries are expected to begin in August with  megawatts and to increase 
to  megawatts in August  
The contract also allows the state to buy up to  hours during peak 
periods from  new generating units once they are built 
In February Calpine signed a year contract valued at  billion with 
the DWR to supply  megawatts A megawatt is enough to light  homes 
Separately Duke Energy Corp said it is in discussions with the DWR on 
longterm power supply contracts 
The Gas Co agrees 
to buy gas for PGE 
The Gas Co said Wednesday that it reached an agreement with Pacific Gas  
Electric Co to buy natural gas for the troubled utility for the next month 
PGE which is near bankruptcy has said it is running out of gas supplies 
and is unable to buy more because creditors are hesitant to sell to it 
PGE had asked the state Public Utilities Commission to force The Gas Co 
which serves all of Orange County to step in and buy gas for PGE on an 
emergency basis 
The Gas Co said the agreement with PGE includes a guarantee that The Gas 
Co will be paid out of the money received from PGE customer bills Unpaid 
balances cannot exceed  million said Gas Co spokeswoman Denise King


PUC chief defends actions in crisis
Loretta Lynch blames the energy crunch on the failure of deregulation 
creditrating firm says state will continue to feel its effects 
By Andrew LaMar and Mike Taugher
TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
SACRAMENTO  Loretta Lynch who has faced close scrutiny as president of the 
state Public Utilities Commission defended her handling of the electricity 
crisis Wednesday and said she wishes the agency had recognized sooner that 
deregulation was not working 
Appearing before reporters at a luncheon the yearold attorney offered a 
harsh assessment of deregulation and said California has not faced the same 
degree of uncertainty since the s 
From my perspective the system that we created was built on a theory and a 
hope and a promise and that promise is unrealized and the theory was faulty 
and so therefore the hope remains unfulfilled Lynch said Im from 
Independence Mo you have got to show me how were going to get to the 
nirvana of the plan for deregulation 
Lynch said the PUC is working feverishly on three things 
To advise the Legislature on scores of energy bills 
To legally defend its decision to keep rates frozen on two utility companies 
To prepare to decide whether to extend or increase a  percent electricity 
rate hike approved in January 
Meanwhile the Wall Street creditrating firm Standard  Poors issued a 
report on the dangers of the energy crisis that said California will feel its 
effects throughout  and beyond 
Damage has been contained to the states utilities which are nearly broke 
and the state treasury which SP said is insulated from credit problems 
because of its ample reserves and ability to borrow 
But SP analysts said the combination of the energy crisis and a nationwide 
economic slowdown could restrict the states ability to deal with budgetary 
issues that could come up if the economy continues to slow Also it could 
strap the budgets of cities counties and other local governments if the 
state decides to cut payments to them 
In addition to the overall economic slowing that is clearly evident 
nationally the utility crisis has hit California at a time when the 
technology sector the growth of which has played a significant role in the 
states economy over the past several years is undergoing a significant 
retraction SP warned 
As for Lynch she challenged several popular assumptions as myths First she 
said deregulation failed on its own not because politicians cut it short 
Second she said the PUC did not stop utilities from arranging longterm 
contracts to buy electricity as they have claimed 
And the defense of the PUCs rate freeze in court is not a losing 
proposition she said 
It is true that the utilities came to the commission and to me personally in 
October and said End the rate freeze We are hurting Lynch said When we 
looked at the request it really did put us between a rock and a hard place 
and thats a rock and a hard place we remain in today 
But Lynch said if the PUC had lifted the rate freeze we would have by 
administrative fiat plunged the rest of California into the price volatility 
that San Diego experienced this summer 
As it is the commission is studying the market value of the assets Southern 
California Edison and PGE were supposed to sell under the terms of 
deregulation Once the commission sets the market value it can determine 
whether the utilities are eligible to raise rates 
In other developments Wednesday 
Power generator Calpine Corp announced two longterm electricity contracts 
that will require energystarved California to pay up to  billion to keep 
the lights on in as many as  million homes 
With the latest agreements San Josebased Calpine has three separate 
longterm electricity contracts with the state Department of Water Resources 
which is shopping for deals that will spread the soaring cost of power over 
several years 
Environmentalists urged Gov Gray Davis to upgrade his proposal to obtain 
development rights for scenic acreage owned by the states beleaguered 
utilities saying the state should obtain the properties outright 
As part of a utility bailout package the governor has recommended Edison and 
PGE turn over development rights to more than  acres including scenic 
parcels in the Sierra and  miles of high voltage transmission lines 
among other considerations 
A Republican assemblyman attacked Davis for comments he made in Washington 
DC on Tuesday The governor said the deals he is negotiating with utility 
companies to buy their transmission lines would complete the legislative 
fixes needed and it means we are basically on the downside of the problem 
But Assemblyman Tony Strickland RThousand Oaks questioned whether there 
would be enough power this summer or if federal regulators would approve the 
state purchase of transmission lines 
Its irresponsible to call this crisis nearly over Strickland said There 
are still way too many unknowns


CalISO Says Suppliers Overcharged 

Power State report calls for a refund of  million above reasonable 
prices Generators deny gouging 

By NANCY VOGEL and JENIFER WARREN Times Staff Writers


SACRAMENTOWholesale electricity suppliers overcharged Californias 
utilities more than  million during December and January an amount that 
the federal government should demand be refunded according to a 
noholdsbarred state report released Thursday
The report by the California Independent System Operator which oversees 
the flow of electricity in the state said power suppliers charged  
billion during those two months alonemore than they did for all of 
Studying various market dynamics the agency concluded that there was a 
prima facie case that the unnamed generators and marketers had charged  
million above just and reasonable prices warranting further investigation 
and federal hearings into the appropriateness of refunds
The state report is the most accusatory of a number of studies 
undertaken to determine why wholesale electricity prices have soared in 
California since last summer throwing the states biggest utilities into 
financial crisis and dashing hopes for lower consumer rates under 
deregulation
The study also provides new ammunition to members of Californias 
congressional delegation who have unsuccessfully been pressing the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission to impose price ceilings on wholesale 
electricity costs
Generators defended their operating practices and rejected the 
allegation that they had raked in unfairly large profits in December and 
January
We have played by the rules acted ethically and legally in all our 
operations said Richard Wheatley a spokesman for Houstonbased Reliant 
Energy which owns power plants capable of supplying more than  million 
homes We have nothing to hide
Gary Ackerman executive direcor of the Western Power Trading Forum 
said the CalISO report does not account for less tangible factors that tend 
to drive up prices such as political and financial uncertainties
Those are the things my people take into account when deciding whether 
to sell into California said Ackerman He noted that in the second week of 
December a period analyzed in the CalISO report electricity prices were 
higher in the Pacific Northwest than in California
The report he said provides some reasonable questions which will be 
responded to by my members under FERC authority
CalISO officials stressed Thursday that they are not accusing any 
seller of inflating prices but are simply asking for federal action to 
restrain costs
We have not seen prices come down to what we feel are justifiable 
levels said Anjali Sheffrin director of market analysis for CalISO
Although federal energy commission officials on Thursday refused to 
comment on the study many experts predicted that refunds would not be 
forthcoming
Since July when Gov Gray Davis first asked the federal commission to 
give San Diego Gas  Electric customers refunds for electricity costs that 
doubled and in some cases tripled the agency has refused to order power 
sellers to give back some of their profits to California utilities and 
consumers
The commission charged by Congress with assuring just and reasonable 
wholesale electricity rates has also resisted imposing firm price caps on 
Californias electricity market In November the commission called that 
market dysfunctional and vulnerable to manipulation by power sellers but 
the agency has so far failed to document or punish specific cases of such 
anticompetitive behavior
The real question is what is FERC going to do with all of this said 
Gary Stern chief of market analysis for Southern California Edison once one 
of the two biggest buyers of electricity in California Based on past 
history we think theyre probably going to say they dont see wrongdoing 
that provides a reason for refund
Determining rebates could prove a logistical nightmare for federal 
regulators and CalISO Stern said but the data exist to show how much it 
cost power plant owners to generate electricity and what price they charged
Given that Edison and PGE have defaulted on payments of hundreds of 
millions to power sellers Stern said a rebate order wouldnt lead to 
reimbursement for individual utility customers Instead it could help the 
utilities eliminate some of their debt to generators and marketers
Edison and PGE have been pushed nearly to bankruptcy by high wholesale 
costs which they could not pass on to their customers because of a 
stateimposed rate freeze 
Last week Davis announced that Edison had agreed in principle to state 
financial help in exchange for its transmission lines Negotiations with PGE 
continue
The Folsombased CalISO drew its conclusions after reviewing 
electricity purchases made between Dec   and Jan  
To calculate the cost of producing electricity in those months CalISO 
analysts assumed power plant owners were buying natural gas from the spot 
market where prices soared this winter and were running old inefficient 
plants They also assumed relatively high prices for air emission credits in 
Southern California and added a  buffer to the operating costs
CalISO officials then compared these costs with the prices sellers were 
paid Their report did not name the individual sellers which range from the 
province of British Columbia to the publicly owned Los Angeles Department of 
Water and Power to private companies
Several lawmakers praised the report as long overdue
Its about time said state Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey 
chairwoman of the Senate Energy Committee She said that the desire among 
some legislators to seize power plants and take other drastic actions stems 
from the sense that theres no one willing to enforce the provisions of the 
federal power act regarding just and reasonable rates
The utilities are doing a great job looking out for their shareholders 
but who is looking out for ratepayers she asked
Consumer advocacy groups applauded CalISOs action and said the 
agencys evidence of overcharges underscored the need for hard price caps or 
a tax on generator profits
Its certainly not news to us that the generators are charging 
excessive wholesale prices said Mindy Spatt spokeswoman for the Utility 
Reform Network of San Francisco If there had been a real price cap this 
investigation would not be necessary 
Californias congressional delegation has pushed hard in recent months 
for legislation that would impose temporary price controls on wholesale power 
supplies in the West On Wednesday a bipartisan team met with Curtis Hebert 
chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and came away 
discouraged by Heberts opposition to price caps
The federal commission has imposed a socalled soft cap of  per 
megawatthour in Californias electricity market When sellers ask a higher 
price they must explain why it is necessary 
Within  days the commission can launch a review of those bids that 
could lead to refunds So far the federal panel has ordered none On 
Thursday CalISO asked the commission to extend the twomonth deadline in 
its examination of the purchases made during December and January

Power profits targeted Generators urged to forgive some of utilities debts
By Stuart Leavenworth and Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writers
Published March   
They are cocky and defiant and unabashedly rich Over the past year the 
companies that generate and trade much of Californias electricity have made 
multimilliondollar profits off the states power crunch 
Yet pressure is mounting for these power producers to return some of their 
profits or at least forgive some debts they are owed by the states troubled 
utilities 
A spokesman for Gov Gray Davis said Thursday that at least two energy 
companies have volunteered to forgive some debt a development that could 
give Davis leverage over other suppliers 
Also Thursday the states Independent System Operator declared that some 
power merchants may have overcharged the state and utilities by as much as 
 million in December and January ISO officials asked federal regulators 
to confirm their findings and seek refunds from the generators 
Several key lawmakers say any deal to rescue Pacific Gas and Electric Co and 
Southern California Edison must include debt forgiveness by generators and 
other creditors 
They have to get a haircut like anyone else said state Sen Debra Bowen 
the powerful chair of the Senate Energy Committee Im not saying they have 
to walk around like Jesse Ventura but they cant continue to walk around 
like Don King either 
So far most generators adamantly refuse to discuss debt forgiveness saying 
their electricity prices are reasonable 
Steven Kean executive vice president of Enron Corp said he didnt see any 
reason to forgive any debts A spokeswoman for Mirant Corp said company 
officials expect full payment 
Richard Wheatley a spokesman for Reliant Energy Inc said lawmakers urging 
debt relief are engaged in wishful thinking 
The more they discuss it the more they hope it might turn into reality 
said Wheatley whose company is owed  million From our perspective 
its not open to negotiation 
But Bowen and others say generators bondholders and other utility creditors 
have some good reasons to budge 
If Edison and PGE go bankrupt Bowen says the generators might have to wait 
years to get even partial payment Thats because they are unsecured 
creditors  meaning they dont hold any collateral to secure payment of 
their debts 
It is not very hard to figure out from a dollars and cents standpoint said 
Bowen DMarina Del Rey who has been talking to some of the generators about 
debt forgiveness If you are owed  bucks would you rather get  
several months from now or would you rather take your chances with 
bankruptcy attorneys and get  three years from now 
Steve Maviglio a spokesman for Davis said the governor has received a 
couple of unsolicited offers from generators willing to forgive debts as 
part of a deal Maviglio declined to name the companies but said It is all 
part of the ongoing negotiations 
The game of cat and mouse comes as Davis and lawmakers try to gain leverage 
over five companies  AES Corp Duke Energy Corp Dynegy Inc Mirant and 
Reliant  that bought power plants from the Californiabased utilities in 
the early days of the states foray into deregulation 
Because of that divesture much of Californias power is controlled by 
outofstate generators and their trading subsidiaries or by independent 
brokers such as Enron the countrys biggest electricity marketer 
In recent months at least five classaction lawsuits have accused these 
companies of manipulating and inflating electricity prices either by 
intentionally shutting down plants or by buying natural gas cheaply and using 
it to generate electricity sold at a severalhundredpercent markup 
On Thursday the nonprofit corporation that manages most of the states 
electric grid revealed data that could support claims of price gouging 
In a filing with federal regulators the Independent System Operator said the 
wholesalers overcharged the ISO by  million for spotmarket purchases in 
December and January 
The ISOs findings are based on federal price caps that say any bids above a 
certain level be justified in writing The ISO calculated the suppliers 
costs threw in a  percent profit margin  and concluded that the 
generators had sold scads of power at unreasonable prices 
The states grid managers want the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to 
seek refunds from the generators if regulators confirm that overcharging took 
place But some doubt the FERC will act given its past reluctance to set 
price controls or interfere in Californias energy markets 
I dont think they have a whole lot of chance with FERC said Severin 
Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute 
Federal officials he said are likely to bend over backward to excuse the 
prices 
Wholesalers also doubted the ISO report would lead anywhere saying it left 
out significant legitimate costs of selling electricity to California 
Suppliers had the right to charge a credit premium as the risks of 
nonpayment began rising said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading 
Forum Not only did the ISO become an uncreditworthy buyer  because it got 
its money from Edison and PGE  but the whole political climate in 
California added to the wholesalers risks Ackerman said 
Whether or not the ISO filing prompts action from federal regulators it 
could help lawmakers pressure the generators 
State Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana said he wants to sort out how much of the 
debts piled up by PGE and Edison since last summer were the result of 
electricity prices that could be deemed unjust and unreasonable under 
federal and state laws 
Since every regulatory body has concluded those costs were unjust and 
unreasonable a portion if not a very significant part of that past debt 
ought to be forgiven Dunn said 
Some analysts say state leaders cant push the generators too far since they 
depend on energy companies to build new power plants  a supply boost that 
theoretically would lower energy prices 
Dunn acknowledges that is a concern but says the Legislature also cant 
afford to ignore charges that generators have gouged utilities and 
ratepayers 
That is the game of chicken we are in now Dunn said And up to this 
point it is only the state that has blinked 
The issue of debt forgiveness could become moot if Davis cant strike a deal 
with PGE and San Diego Gas  Electric to buy their transmission systems 
Last week Davis announced a tentative agreement to acquire Edisons power 
lines for  billion and is reportedly close to coming to terms with SDGE 
But PGE has so far rejected the governors overtures and on Thursday it 
added to a litany of financial woes The San Franciscobased company 
defaulted on another  billion worth of payments to electricity 
suppliers It did however make partial payments totaling  million to 
the ISO which bought power from the wholesalers on the utilitys behalf and 
to a group of cogenerators and alternative energy providers 
If talks with the state break down one of PGEs alternatives would be 
bankruptcy court where a judge would determine how its assets would be 
divided among creditors An alternative scenario has one or all of the 
generators going to court to force PGE into bankruptcy but Bowen for one 
is doubtful that will happen anytime soon 
If they the generators thought they would come out better in a bankruptcy 
we would be there already said Bowen whose committee would have to approve 
any rescue plan for the utilities 
So that means they have to give Everyone has to give

No state is an island entire of itself every state is a piece of the 
continent a part of the main John Donne

California Gov Gray Davis has seemingly hit on a plan that he thinks will 
solve his states energy problems 
Acquire some  miles of transmission lines for between  billion and 
 billion to keep the bankruptcy wolf away from the states three 
investorowned utilities

Create a public power authority to buy build and operate power plants 
financed with up to  billion in state bonds

Not raise customer rates to pay for at least  billion in bonds used to pay 
for power 
Sounds great doesnt it Something for everyoneno more painsounds 
suspiciously like Californias original deregulation planitself a misnomer 
California wasnt deregulated it was restructured 

Energy island wont work
But Daviss efforts to in effect create the electrical island of California 
will not work many say The governors control of transmission doesnt solve 
the immediate demandsupply conundrum 

And creation of the fancysounding California Consumer Power and Conservation 
Financing Authority to buy build and operate power plants could drive 
private developers out of the Golden Statewho wants to compete against the 
ultimate governmentsubsidized entity 

Davis is in effect nationalizing the power industry in California said 
Jonathan Gottlieb a partner in Washington DC law firm Baker  McKenzies 
North American Utility and Energy Products Group Command and control 
economies have been collapsing around the worldexcept in California 

The problems with the California power industry are numerous and beaten to 
death by the media It appears everything went wrong that could go wrongall 
at onceMurphys Law in the absurd 

Just as numerous as the problems are the number of entities which can be 
fingered as having a hand in the debacle 

All that said Gov Davis feels he has the magic bullet which will make 
everything right take over much of the system force those 
outofstatebased generators to act responsibly bail out the incumbent 
utilities and not raise customer rates 

But has anyone looked longer term than the next few months concerning the 
consequences of Davis moves Anyone stop to think what happens if and when 
the state does take control 

Who runs the stateowned system 
With the transmissionlines buy you have a mechanism which gives the 
utilities cash to pay off the debt incurred in buying wholesale power said 
Craig Pirrong a commodity markets expert and professor in the Olin School of 
Business at Washington University in St Louis 

But now there are operational questions Pirrong continued Is the state 
the most efficient entity to operate and maintain the wires system 

Good question You have to find someone to run the system once you take it 
over said William Hogan a professor in Harvard Universitys John F 
Kennedy School of Government So you either contract or hire utility 
employees 

There is precedent obviously for governmentowned and operated utilities 
In the United States more than  municipals operate today while 
internationally a number of staterun utilities are in operation for example 
Electricit de France But government ownership of utilities appears to be on 
the way out across the world the experts say 

Look whats happening worldwide said Adrian Moore executive director of 
the Los Angelesbased free market think tank Reason Public Policy Institute 
Over the last seven or eight years billions of dollars worth of utility 
privatizations have taken place Germany and Italy for example are selling 
off huge tranches of their national utilities 

Municipal utilities tout their lower costs per customer but those figures 
are deceptive some industry watchers believe 

There are a lot of tax advantages and hidden subsidies in municipal 
utilities that mask the real cost said economist Murray Weidenbaum scholar 
in residence at the Jones Graduate School of Management at Rice University in 
Houston Texas and the former first chairman of President Reagans Council 
of Economic Advisers If you move to a staterun utility you can almost 
guarantee costs will go up over time Moore said 

Politics taking precedence
With state control of Californias transmission lines many experts see 
politics taking precedence over economicsor needwhen decisions are made 
concerning where to build new lines 

You can see gamesmanship and lobbying taking precedence moving away from 
economic drivers toward political drivers Washington Universitys Pirrong 
said 

On the generation side many of the same problems associated with assuming 
command of the wires could occur 

Generators including Mirant Corp and Duke Energy already publicly expressed 
concerns with the wires acquisition specifically will they be shut out of 
access to get their power to market 

I can see politically that theyve got to get something out of this to sell 
the plan to consumers but we need to make sure we arent discriminated 
against Mirant President Marce Fuller said during the recent Cambridge 
Energy Research Associates energy conference in Houston 

Discrimination against incumbents could occur but what about bias against 
potential generators With the establishment of the Consumer Power and 
Conservation Financing Board what private company would want to bid against 
the sixth largest economy in the world 

With the government involved companies would be reluctant to build new 
plants without a government contract because the government is subsidizing 
construction said Harvards Hogan 

Wheres the states comparative advantage in building new plants 
Washington Universitys Pirrong asked 

FERC must weighin
There is another major player in Californias ascension to wires 
owneroperator the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC The Federal 
Power Act puts FERC right in the middle of the California takeover said 
Baker  McKenzies Gottlieb 

FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert has used the word nationalization publicly to 
describe what California is proposing and has said he has definite concerns 
about the proposal Gottlieb said I dont think FERC can say no to the 
California takeover but they could weigh it down with conditions 

One of those conditions may be a tradeoff FERC will approve Californias 
takeover of transmission wires in exchange for the state giving control of 
the lines to multistate regional transmission organizations 

A quick fix could take months
No one including Davis sees this plan happening quickly In a presentation 
Wednesday to analysts in New York the governor admitted it would take up to 
four more weeks to reach agreement with PGE Corp Pacific Gas  Electric Co 
for its wires He also admitted he cannot win enough Republicans to pass the 
bill with the twothirds majority needed for immediate implementation Bills 
in California passed with a simple majority must wait  days before going 
into effect 

Thus the entire process may not be over for at least another six weeks and 
even then the Davis plan could face a ballot initiative But for the sake of 
argument assume Gov Davis gets his way and takes control of the 
investorowned utilities wires and begins building and buying plants Where 
does such a massive undertaking leave the Golden State in three to five 
years 

All things add up to a pretty grim situation said the Reason Public Policy 
Institutes Moore Five years from now just because the state is purchasing 
power we will have prices higher than the US average That will be 
exacerbated by the state owning the wires and building the plants 

Im very dubious the governmentrun utility in the longrun will be very 
expensive Harvards Hogan concurred 

Baker  McKenzies Gottlieb sees the California screen test as providing the 
impetus for a huge infrastructure buildout nationwide One recent survey 
found that some  billion in plant financings within the United States are 
projected for just the first three months of compared to  billion for 
all of  

A textbook case
According to economist Weidenbaum the California energy debacle answers the 
question does the government deregulate as badly as it regulates with a 
huge exclamation point 

California is a textbook dramatization of the shortcomings of government 
involvement with business Weidenbaum said You now have Chapter Two in 
that book we already have Chapter One 

The English poet Donne said And therefore never send to know for whom the 
bell tolls it tolls for thee 

In California that bell is clanging 












ExRegulator Urges Temporary Federal Price Caps on Power

Carolyn Lochhead Chronicle Washington Bureau 

FridayMarch   








Washington  Federal energy regulators should intervene more forcefully in 
Californias energy crisis a former Reaganappointed regulator said 
yesterday 
while other experts feared the financial effects could balloon into another 
savingsandloan bailout disaster 
Independent regulatory experts speaking at a highprofile panel on the energy 
crunch also said Gov Gray Davis may be whistling in the dark in his 
assurances that the power crisis will be largely resolved by summer 
I think there is a fairly compelling argument that something needs to be 
done said Elizabeth Moler appointed to the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission by President Ronald Reagan and named chairwoman by President Bill 
Clinton 
Moler speaking to the Brookings Institution and the American Enterprise 
Institute Joint Center for Regulatory Studies said some form of temporary 
federal intervention on wholesale prices is needed so long as it does not 
discourage investment in new generation capacity 
Davis and Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif have urged federal regulators to 
impose temporary price controls to give the state breathing room 
The chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Curt Hebert is 
strongly opposed to price caps saying they would discourage investment and 
delay resolution of the crisis California needs to lift the electricity rate 
freeze on consumers to encourage conservation and restore the finances of the 
bankrupt investorowned utilities Hebert has argued 
But Moler faulted federal regulators and the California Public Utilities 
Commission both of which oversaw the states deregulation plan for allowing 
the problem to fester 
The signs were there in June that something needed to happen Moler said 
noting that electricity deregulation is complex and always needs adjustments 
Id like to think I would have been reading the market monitoring reports  
Moler said Id like to think I would have been on the airplane to San 
Francisco every other week and on the other weeks the CPUC would have been 
on a plane to Washington 
Moler also faulted state PUC members for blaming the crisis on their 
predecessors Im pretty amazed the CPUC is still blaming Dan Fessler the 
former chairman Moler said Hes been gone for three years 
Moler noted that the states plan to take over the utilities transmission 
lines needs federal regulatory approval which Hebert indicated he opposes 
comparing the move to nationalization 
Davis assertions this week to Washington policymakers and Wall Street 
analysts that he has the crisis under control were also viewed dubiously 
Noting that peak California power demand will rise to  megawatts in the 
summer from  in the winter Robert Litan director of the Joint Center 
for Regulatory Studies said You do your own math If you think the problem 
is bad now you aint seen nothing yet 
Litan said the states partial electricity deregulation was a giant gamble 
that freed wholesale prices would stay below fixed retail prices but the bet 
went bad and now state taxpayers are paying the cost 
I used to study SLs and what California is doing sounds a lot like what 
the federal government did for  years which was pray and hope that the 
problem goes away he said 
California is paying roughly  billion a month for electricity while state 
officials try to craft a longterm solution 
Paul Joskow director of the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy 
Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said state and federal 
policymakers must devise a longterm blueprint that encourages investment in 
new generation and offers price stability to consumers 
I havent seen any longterm plan yet for where they are going in 
California Joskow said    I think the governor owes that to the 
citizens of California because now were going from week to week and you 
know as well as I do what its going to be six months from now

NEWS 
PGE to Pay Creditors Only    Smaller suppliers outraged over plan
David Lazarus

   
The San Francisco Chronicle 
FINAL 
Page A 
Copyright  
Pacific Gas and Electric Co said yesterday it would pay only about  cents 
on the dollar for its outstanding power bills sparking outrage among smaller 
creditors who accused the utility of driving them out of business 
In a filing to securities regulators PGE revealed it would pay just  
million of about billion due for recent electricity purchases 
How would you feel if your boss gave you just  percent of your paycheck 
and said hell get back to you for the rest asked Bob Judd director of the 
California Biomass Energy Alliance representing operators of  woodfired 
plants statewide 
PGEs filing marks a turning point in California s energy crisis It is now 
possible that not only will the states largest utility go under but it 
could take a number of power generators with it 
PGE now in talks with the governor on a possible financial bailout is 
telling creditors to be thankful for whatever they get If the utility 
declares bankruptcy all parties know many creditors may receive nothing 
Still time is running out for Ridgewood Power a New Jersey company with  
plants in California  It already has had to shut down three facilities in 
PGEs service area because it can no longer afford to keep them running 
NOWHERE NEAR 
The amount of money PGE is giving us is nowhere near what we need to pay 
our natural gas suppliers said Martin Quinn Ridgewoods chief operating 
officer We could restart the plants tomorrow if we could be released from 
our PGE contracts and sell to another buyer 
He added that his company would ask federal regulators to nullify its 
contracts with PGE so Ridgewood could bid for alternative power contracts 
being offered by California state officials 
PGEs larger creditors reacted more cautiously to word that the utility 
would pay only a fraction of its outstanding bills 
We have to study the consequences and see said Richard Wheatley a 
spokesman for Houstons Reliant Energy which formed a creditors committee 
last month with other leading electricity providers We dont know how much 
of the money well get 
Reliant and other major creditors are grappling with how much leeway to grant 
PGE on its unpaid bills before deciding to cut their losses and push the 
cashstrapped utility into bankruptcy 
VERY CONCERNED 
We are very concerned about the credit issue said Steve Stengel a 
spokesman for Houstons Dynegy Inc another member of the creditors 
committee But we are still interested in finding a comprehensive solution 
to California s energy situation 
That may depend on the outcome of current talks Gov Gray Davis is holding 
with PGE and Southern California Edison to purchase the utilities 
transmission lines as part of a multibilliondollar bailout package 
PGE and Edison are saddled with nearly  billion in debt as a result of 
illconceived efforts to deregulate the states electricity market 
The announcement of partial payments was not a complete surprise to PGEs 
creditors The utilitys chief financial officer Kent Harvey told investors 
in a conference call last month that PGE would prefer to make partial 
payments than no payments at all 
PGE has defaulted on more than  million in shortterm debt payments 
since January amid growing concerns that the utility will file for bankruptcy 
protection 
In response three California counties have formed their own creditors 
committee to recoup investments in PGEs shortterm debt also known as 
commercial paper 
The three  Santa Cruz Riverside and Siskiyou counties  are inviting 
other public agencies to join forces in seeking compensation from PGE for 
the defaulted payments 
The prospect of PGE filing for bankruptcy has diminished somewhat in recent 
weeks as Davis and Sacramento lawmakers scrambled to come up with proposals 
to rescue California s utilities from financial ruin 
Although Edison has said it is prepared to sell its power lines to the state 
for nearly  billion PGE so far has refused to follow suit 
However as The Chronicle reported yesterday the utility retained outside 
counsel this week to offer advice on a possible sale of its power lines 
increasing the likelihood that a deal may be in the works 
SUITS ALLEGE MISMANAGEMENT 
Separately PGE said yesterday it had been hit with a pair of lawsuits 
seeking almost  billion in restitution for financial mismanagement 
One suit charges the utilitys parent company PGE Corp with violating its 
fiduciary duties by forcing the utility to repurchase shares from the 
corporation for  billion 
The other alleges that PGE Corp collected nearly  billion from the 
utility under a taxsharing arrangement but paid only  billion to the 
government 
The lawsuits were filed in San Francisco Superior Court by Richard D Wilson 
No other information about the plaintiff was immediately available 
 
 Refund RequestedElectricity generators overcharged the state by 
more than a halfbillion dollars in two months and should be forced to return 
the money power officials said yesterday 
The California Independent System Operator said in a filing with the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission that generators appeared to have charged  
million more than what was reasonable 
It was unclear how any refunds might be passed on to consumers About 
twothirds of all power purchases in the spot market were over price caps 
established by FERC said Eric Hildebrandt an ISO manager of market 
monitoring The cap was  per megawatt hour in December and  per 
megawatt hour in January 
The ISO is requesting that FERC order a refund for excessive costs

Here is an initial draft from our attorneys in California on the state 
processes that could be required  In my experience the single biggest issue 
the utilities have is the transfer of the rights of way  there are 
thousands of these  each like an individual contract  If the state tried 
eminent domain it seems like it could face a longtime in the courts to 
finish that process

The first meeting relative to the SB x fix to the suspension of da 
contained in AB x was held at the Capitol today  Present were ESPs 
consumer groups business interests the utlities and representatives from 
the Department of Finance the DWR and Finances Bond Counsel  The meeting 
was led by Laurence Lingbloom from Senator bowens office

Aaron Thomas led off with an articualtion of the AReM business coalition 
proposal Successive presentations were given by interests who submitted 
either correspondence or draft proposals the details of which can be 
discussed in tomorrows conference call

Of particular note and the greatest obstacle facing the future of da was 
the presentation by the attorney representing the Dept of Finance  He 
expressed concern over broad exemptions from exit fees ie all residential 
and small commercial customers  kw and broad authority to opt out will 
make it extremely difficult to actually sell the bonds  

We need to follow up with Finance their counsel and DWR to allay their 
fears the sooner the better  We need to be able to speak their language on 
bonding particulars and we need to be able to articulate our position in 
terms relavant to their bonding requirements  We can discuss this further in 
the call tomorow

Finally Lingbloom said he will circulate a proposal of his own by midweek 
next  The general tenor at the conclusion of the meeting was not good we 
have our work cut out for us

Until tomorrow

Greetings All

First I am apologizing in advance for any typos in this email  Schedule is 
very tight but I wanted to make sure that everyone had it first thing this 
morning with some backup info that Ive included below

Attached is the email that was sent to Ken Lays office yesterday evening for 
delivery to Sen Brulte  Its of course confidential  Few points

I dont have Bevs email so if you could please forward to her that would 
be appreciated
As we discussed Jim Mike Bev Scott Hedy on our lengthy call on 
Wednesday Im assuming that the plan is still to wallpaper Sacramento with 
our proposed legislation
This email does not contain the legislation  Mike sent the final versions 
of our legislation out yesterday except for the siting piece which I 
believe Brian Cragg of Mikes office is finalizing today
Youll note that we promise Senator Brulte in the email that well deliver to 
his office today the proposed legislation  Again based on our call on 
Wednesday Im assuming that we would simultaneously release the proposed 
legislation to the rest of the world at the same time
When we spoke on Wednesday we decided that the Sacramento team would 
determine to whom we would circulate the proposed legislation at the same 
time that we deliver the Senator Brulte Im assuming that you folks will 
handle that end of things  Please let us know at your convenience to whom 
youve decided to circulate
This email does however include a summary of our proposed legislation  
But Im not certain that the summary included in this email is the 
appropriate language to distribute to the world or if well need instead 
to tailor some new language  I think we all agreed that we need a one 
pager to accompany the legislative package so that we can communicate the 
package effectively
We also discussed the need to quickly develop a coalition to support our 
proposals  We didnt finalize that plan  Perhaps the Sacramento team could 
propose a plan to do that  Perhaps we could start with our friends in the 
Direct Access coalition
We also talked about the need at this point to engage in PR and to get the PR 
machinery activated also with the goal of effectively communicating our 
legislative package message  Were in a meeting with folks today where we 
can discuss getting that side of things going and Karen Denne has contacted 
Marathon and theyre pondering some things that we can do in the near term
Youll note that theres a considerable amount of information about the DWR 
credit issue  As I recollect we discussed the issue in depth on the call  
You note that attached to the email is a legislative fix to ABX that could 
solve the credit issue and an attached set of taking points related to a 
second alternative to solving the credit issue  a PUC order clarifying that 
DWR will get its money for power purchase costs
Note also that Steve Kean reminded me that weve got to continue to push to 
get the utilities out of the merchant function  Accordingly Ive put a 
brief paragraph on that issue in the note to Brulte in the last section 
legislative solution under the topic create a real competitive retail 
market in California  To the best of my knowledge we dont have 
legislative language on that piece yet and it seems that well need to 
discuss it in considerably more depth before doing so


If you have any questions about any of the materials in the email please 
dont hesitate to contact me or Jim or Sandi to discuss  I can be best 
reached to day by pager at   

Thanks to all for helping pull this together

Best
Jeff

Jim
It was a pleasure speaking with you yesterday  Based on our conversation 
this email includes the following

An Enron contact to discuss developing smallscale generation on Tribal lands

Our views on the impediments to distributed generation and suggestions on how 
to remove those impediments

A description of the credit issues that continue to impede DWRs ability to 
sign contracts with power suppliers and options to resolve them Two 
possible options for addressing the credit issue are  a California PUC 
order clarifying that DWR will recover its power purchase costs through 
rates and  an amendment to ABX designed to accomplish the same goal  I 
have attached talking points regarding the California PUC order and proposed 
amendments to ABX  We believe that an amendment to ABX is the preferable 
option

Our assessment of the supply demand picture in California

Our suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near 
and longterm electricity crisis in California  We will deliver to your 
office tomorrow detailed legislative language  In those materials we will 
also identify existing bills that we believe can easily accommodate our 
proposed language

I hope that the information is useful  Please do not hesitate to contact me 
if you would like to discuss these materials further or if there is anything 
else that I can do to assist you

Regards
Ken

 Key Barriers to Distributed Generation

Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Standby Charges

Solution The executive orders issued by the Governor on February th took a 
step in the right direction  Utility standby charges have always been 
designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position extract 
monopoly prices from customers or both  But there is no reason to limit the 
elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than 
MW  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for 
California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduce 
the risk of black outs this summer  We would propose lifting the cap by 
offering amendments to SBX which is designed to facilitate development of 
distributed generation
 
Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with 
investorowned and municipal utilities

Solution   The Governors executive order regarding interconnection is a 
step in the right directionDD requires utilities to complete 
interconnection studies within  days  California should ensure that this 
requirement applies to all generation facilities including distributed 
generation  In addition the financial conflicts the utilities face when 
interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome 
through executive orders or other regulations  To the greatest extent 
possible California should shift control over interconnection away from the 
utility and place that control with the California ISO  This could be 
accomplished through amendments to SB X

Permitting and Air Quality Issues
Developers of distributed ie onsite generation that is  MWs or 
greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission and 
therefore face all of the impediments to development that largescale 
generation faces  

Solution California should ensure that the executive orders D thru 
D issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant 
output apply equally to smaller scale distributed generation facilities 
In addition distributed generation that is less than  MWs continues to 
face local opposition  The State should ensure that local parochial 
interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects  
These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SBX

 Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in ABX to Purchase 
Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities 

Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with 
suppliers
Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with the 
goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible
However ambiguities contained in ABX have created significant credit risk 
concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms
We understand that the lions share of counterparties share Enrons credit 
risk concerns
Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and 
is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to 
both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements 
going forward

Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue

Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority
The language in ABX is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to 
charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power  From our 
analysis of the bill the language in ABX appears to leave intact the 
California PUCs exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California  As 
such suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rates 
adequate charges to cover DWRs costs of power purchases

Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract Prudence
The language in ABX leaves open the possibility that the California Public 
Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are 
imprudent  On the basis of such a finding the CPUC could then refuse to 
allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power 
purchases  Consequently suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree 
to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that 
DWR has entered into with suppliers
 
Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to 
Recover DWRs Costs of Power Purchases
In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority 
noted above the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to 
the specific ratemaking mechanics that ABX directs the PUC to employ to 
permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs Based on our analysis it is 
extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensure 
DWR recovers its power purchase costs  Moreover as currently drafted it is 
difficult to determine whether ABX would even permit the PUC to include in 
rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWRs power purchase 
costs  Again this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since 
suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover 
from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power

Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk 

We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit risk 
issues  We have identified three options

Amend ABX
The amendments which are attached to this email would clarify that a the 
PUC would accept as prudent and reasonable all purchase costs incurred by 
DWR and b the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary to 
ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases  This is the 
preferred option though we understand that the there may be some political 
challenges standing in the way of amending ABX  See attached file 
entitled AmendABXdoc

Clarify the Ambiguities in ABX through an Order Issued by the PUC and 
through Contract Language
This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to 
implement  However it is more complicated and could take significantly more 
time to implement than the legislative fix  We have attached electronic 
copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC 
would need to issue under this option  See attached file entitled 
cpuctalkingpointsdoc

Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk
As indicated in our letter responding to DWRs RFP we are willing to accept 
other forms of credit from DWR  Those options include a letter of credit 
cash prepayment or an acceptable form of collateral  DWR officials have 
indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options That is DWR 
prefers to clarify the ambiguities in ABX through a PUC order and through 
contract amendments

 Californias Supplydemand Picture Heading into Summer 

Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research 
Associates CERA a private sector energy think tank have issued reports 
showing that California faces a severe supplydemand imbalance  They differ 
only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available  All 
credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer 
of  and that unless a solution is found immediately blackouts are 
likely  

CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this 
summer by approximately  MW   These numbers are in line with our 
estimates  Californias supply base currently has a  capacity margin well 
below the average  which is recommended for reliable system operation 
in the West  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power 
than other regions reserves are particularly important owing to the 
unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced to 
date In the event of a low rain and snow period the system must possess the 
flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply  
Californias very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to this 
requirement  

Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of  include the early 
drawdown of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage Californias severe 
supplydemand gap emissions restrictions on existing plants and a reduced 
number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the 
utilities  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the current 
pace of siting permitting and construction adequate supplies will not be 
added to correct the market imbalance until  at the earliest

CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately  hours of 
rolling black outs this summer  The CEC paints a considerably more 
optimistic scenario betting that California will bring an additional  
MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand  It is our view that California 
should view the CECs rosy scenario with considerable skepticism

 Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve Californias 
Electricity Crisis

This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution  We will 
deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing 
bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals

As we have suggested throughout the crisis any solution to Californias 
crisis must focus on four issues

Increase supply
Decrease demand
Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market
Return Californias Investorowned utilities to solvency

Increase supplyLegislative vehicle SBX Sher
To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately  years  
Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less 
than a year  In California it takes about six years or longer

The Governors executive orders and Senator Shers siting reform legislation 
are steps in the right direction  Our suggested amendments can improve those 
efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face 
in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit 
requirements included in the CECs certification requirements  Enrons 
proposal seeks to streamline the process for  obtaining credits and  
transfering credits between air districts  In addition it creates an 
innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund 
emissions in advance of obtaining certification and permits the affected air 
districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the 
required reductions in pollution emissions

Decrease demandLegislative Vehicle   ABX Wright
Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California closing 
the supplydemand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the 
best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer  This can be accomplished most 
effectively and quickly in two ways

Buydown demand
California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fund 
to finance DWRs power purchases  California could likely reduce demand more 
economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses would 
be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period eg 
through the summer months  DWR could easily run an online auction to 
determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions  To 
participate businesses would be required to have the metering equipment 
necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the 
reductions  Enron has developed an online auction software package Deal 
Bench that it would be willing to contribute to the effort

Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment
To be successful customers need access to the following key elements

An internet based hourahead price posting system to track the market price 
for hourahead power in real time 
Realtime metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment 
verification
Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be 
paid for load reduction Negawatts

The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would include

creation of additional summer peaking capacity in California particularly 
in the short term without requiring construction of additional generation 
resources
reduction of  peak or superpeak load on the overstressed California 
electric system thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity in 
the state
fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full risk 
of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to 
customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for 
responding 

We estimate that we could generate a summer  onpeak demand response in 
excess of  MW during certain high cost hours and a demand response for 
summer  onpeak hours that could exceed  MW  We further estimate 
that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be  to  times 
that amount  We recommend that the State of California provide rebates 
directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and 
control systems that would support load curtailment implementation

Establish a truly competitive retail electricity marketLegislative vehicle 
SBX
The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego were 
customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy 
service providers  Ironically ABX takes that important option away from 
customers and businesses  It is critical that ABX be amended to remove the 
prohibition against Direct Access

Enrons legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a 
direct access transaction while simultaneously addressing the Department of 
Water Resources concerns about stranded power costs that might result from 
customer migration  

In addition California will only achieve a competitive retail market when 
the utility is removed completely from the procurement function  Procurement 
is not a utility core competency as evidenced by the dire financial 
condition in which the utilities now find themselves  California should 
therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement 
function entirely with the goal of having all customers served by a 
nonutility provider within  months  To execute the transition California 
should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the month period in 
which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments 
of utility load

Return Californias Investorowned utilities to solvencyLegislative vehicle 
ABX
Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand  
In short bankruptcy does nothing to solve Californias supplydemand 
imbalance  In addition bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers 
and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having California 
State government assume the role of electricity buyer for an extended 
period of time  Finally bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidence 
in Californias energy markets and the private sectors willingness to 
participate in that market

California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a 
series of staged rate increases  California should design those rate 
increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without 
shocking the economy or household budgets For example California could 
amortize the recovery of the utilities past debt over a  year period  
In addition the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways 
First the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in 
recognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of AB 
  Second California can net the revenues the utilities have received 
from selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they have 
accrued due to the retail price cap

RE Legislative Status Report Week Ending  


RECENT EVENTS

 The week started off on a very positive note  Monday was a holiday
Tuesday however inevitably came along to spoil all the fun with last
minute committee hearing announcements for some significant bills

 SB x Speier was heard this week in the Senate Energy Committee  This
measure would define owners or operators of any electric generating facility
as a public utility subject to the states jurisdiction  The bill also
places the CPUC in the role of determining scheduled maintenance outages for
generation units  Although the bill goes much further the authors only
intention is to give the CPUC a role in coordinating power plant outages
but seems to not understand the implications of doing it in the manner
outlined in the bill  IEP opposed the bill and testified to that end along
with CMTA the State Chamber of Commerce Enron WSPA and the California
Cogeneration Council  The usual cast of consumer groups supported the bill
Of particular note during the hearing was the hostility shown to the
opposition by the Chair of the Committee Senator Bowen  The message from
the opposition clearly was ignored by the majority of the members as it
passed out of the committee on a partyline vote  IEP is currently
reassessing its strategy on this particular issue because this is not the
only bill that proposes similar changes

 The Assembly Natural Resources Committee chaired by Asm Howard Wayne
was scheduled this week to hear two siting bills  The first was AB x La
Suer which would make various changes to the CEC siting process including
some IEPsponsored language  IEP has a support if amended position on the
bill which has some technical and policy problems but workable  Last
minute amendments offered by Asm Keeley forced Asm La Suer to postpone a
hearing on the bill until next Monday    However because the Keeley
amendments basically gut the current language and turn it into a study bill
La Suer is unlikely to accept them and according to the negative committee
analysis the committee is unlikely to approve the measure in its current
form

AB x Wright on the other hand passed the Natural Resources committee
with only one no vote  AB x would provide expedited siting for a
repower project as defined  However despite IEPs efforts to get the bill
amended the current language would help few if any repower projects  The
author has agreed to continue working with us the environmental community
and the CEC to develop language that works for everyone  IEPs major issue
at this point is that is should actually work  The measure was double
referred to the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee and will be
heard there next

 The negotiated language on the QF issue finally has a vehicle SB x
Battin  All stakeholders are not united in their complete support for the
measure  IEP has may need some additional changes but will be mobilizing
members on Monday to educate Senators on the bill and support the measure in
the Senate Energy Committee when it is scheduled for a hearing  Both SCE
and WSPA also have some outstanding issues but only WSPA so far will be
opposing the bill

 SB x Burton which would establish and state power and financing
authority passed off the Senate Floor  to  this week and is headed to
the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee next IEP met with
Senator Burtons staff this week to talk about amendments to SB x relating
to limiting the Authoritys eminent domain powers  Staff was open to what
we had to say but we have little confidence our recommendations will move
forward with the bill  Regardless IEP will continue to push for amendments
on the Assembly side

 SB x Burton which would require the Governors plan to purchase the
IOUs transmission to be approved first by the Legislature is still
awaiting consideration on the Senate floor

 The Governor had another press conference today to provide a status on
the negotiations between the state and the three IOUs regarding the purchase
of the utilities transmission system  Reuters is saying there the Governor
has a deal with SCE to purchase its share of the power grid for 
billion  Negotiations are still going on with PGE and SDGE  More
information on press conference can be found on the Governors web site

  Attached is the most recent legislative tracking report which includes
all the special session bills introduced through yesterday  Please let me
know if you need copies of any of these bills

I received today the attached letter from Jonathon Rosenthal of Saybrook
Capital

Based on the conversation you and I had yesterday I think that a proper
counter proposal would be to meet in LA organize a credit committee
and instruct Saybrook to seek funding from PGE and SCE  But I would
be interested in hearing your thoughts

Mark and Steve sorry to bother you with this but Im at a loss  This guy 
Jim Cofield called me on my cell phone last night about  pm to get my 
email address  He asked that I take a look at his email in the morning and 
route it to the appropriate person within Enron  

The jpg files below have no information in them but the doc file is a 
 page document with numerous correspondence from Mary Beth Cahill former 
director in the White House Office for Public Liaison to Mr Cofield 
regarding a trip to Nigeria that he supposedly accompanied President Clinton 
on several months ago followed by a number of proprietary information 
documents that mean absolutely nothing to me followed by an overview of 
Nigerias electrical power situation etcThe best I can tell they are 
trying to get Enron to bid on some project in Nigeria

Since this email is copied to the Vice President of the United States in 
addition to several ambassadors I thought it might need attention  If you 
can figure it out please let me know how to proceed  Thanks SRS

Attached is a memo comparing the CECs forecasted supply and a more realistic 
look at what additional resources might be available this summer

The bottom line is that

  The CEC significantly underestimates the outages that may occur this 
summer  They estimate in their  MW supply deficit for the summer that 
expected outages will be around MW  However November and December saw 
significantly higher outage levels   MWs The FERC has investigated 
these outages and found no improprieties just that the plants are overtaxed 
from running at higher than normal capacities

  There are a lot of uncertainties surrounding the  MWs of projected 
supply from rerating restarting existing thermal and renewable projects  It 
is very unclear how much of this will be able to come on line by this summer 
if at all  As evidenced by the email I sent out this morning local 
communities may be very opposed to restarting shut down units  In addition 
these units are likely to be uneconomical

  In the existing resource pool there are roughly  MWs of peaking or 
other generation units that are running up against their operating hour 
limitations from air quality regulations  The Governor has ordered the local 
air quality districts to address these restrictions  We are beginning to 
seem some movement however the US EPA has yet to weigh in on these relaxed 
standards

  The distributed generation backup generation capacity to make up some of 
the shortfall is still an unknown  While there has been some relaxing of the 
limitations on run hours for backup generation at essential public 
services the increase in DG is expected from clean sources not diesel 
emergency generators

  The CEC is doing everything it can to get  MW peaking units online by 
this summer  They are promising a day permit application approval process 
and are offering to pay half of the cost of offsets for clean sources of 
generation in critical areas

Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information

Power line plan has new foes
La Cresta residents vow to keep electricity equipment out of the Cleveland 
Forest and a wilderness area

By Thomas Buckley
The PressEnterprise
LAKE ELSINORE
A new group has raised its objections to Lake Elsinores proposed 
hydroelectric plant and the power lines that might carry its electricity to 
San Diego County 
On Thursday the Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District board set aside for 
further study later this month a motion by Director Gary Kelley to ensure 
that both the lines and the actual power plant that make up a  million 
proposal from Enron North America proceed together 
But residents of La Cresta a mountaintop community near where the lines 
might run did not care whether the plant and lines happened together Many 
of them do not want the lines to be there at all 
We are resolved to keep power lines out of the Cleveland National Forest and 
the San Mateo Wilderness Area said La Cresta resident Bill Stockmar Our 
constituents and the local residents impacted by the proposed project are 
outraged and respectfully demand immediate intervention to stop this project 
at the planning level 
As it stands now the power lines from the hydroelectric plant would run from 
Temescal Canyon to Camp Pendleton along the ridge line of the Elsinore 
Mountains just west of the lake Those lines could run in a narrow strip of 
forest land just west of the La Cresta community 
Enron project manager Rob Bakondy said the final determination of where the 
lines might run is not set but he said the power lines could be built at 
least a year before the plant itself 
Besides serving the hydroelectric plant the power lines could be used to 
replace lines San Diego Gas and Electric wants to build through Murrieta and 
Temecula to bring power to San Diego 
The water district also announced it is considering financing and building 
the lines itself 
District General Manager John Rossi said Wednesday that it was too early to 
say exactly how the lines would be built but that the districts building or 
owning the lines or both in cooperation with Enron is one possibility 
Board President Kris Anderson said it is too early to tell whether it would 
benefit the district to become so directly involved in the project But he 
said the district would be able to borrow the approximately  million 
needed to build the lines at a lower interest rate than a private company 
could get That difference Anderson said could mean extra dollars for the 
district 
How Governor Davis proposal to purchase thousands of miles of transmission 
lines from the ailing utilities will affect the project is not yet clear 
said Enron spokeswoman Kathy Russeth 
The timing of the construction of the project if it is approved by state and 
federal regulators will not be finally known until a contract between Enron 
and the water district has been agreed upon That is expected to happen by 
the end of May



GOP in a fix over power crisis
Leaders seek solutions that wont undercut past support for deregulation 
By Daniel Borenstein
TIMES POLITICAL EDITOR 
California Republican Party leaders are trying desperately to politicize the 
states electricity crisis by blaming Gray Davis but it seems that the 
harder they try the more popular the Democratic governor becomes 
The latest GOP push will come today when party leaders meeting in Sacramento 
for the start of their threeday state convention hold a hastily organized 
workshop on energy 
We should be explaining to California that Gray Davis was asleep at the 
switch last year said one of the scheduled speakers Republican strategist 
Dan Schnur But that message can only work if its coupled with a proposal 
for an alternative solution 
So far that hasnt happened For all the complaints about Davis Republicans 
are moving even slower Looking to  when Davis will stand for 
reelection the GOP has run radio ads attacking the governor for delays But 
the party has yet to distinguish itself with a solid plan of its own 
If Republicans are able in the next couple of months to articulate a clear 
plan which is different from the Democratic plan yes we can use it as a 
political message said Stuart DeVeaux spokesman for the California 
Republican Party 
Are Republicans in Sacramento going to come up with a plan that articulates 
a future for our energy problem Im not telling you its going to be 
revealed this weekend Its my hope it will be articulated this weekend 
Republicans are caught in an ideological quagmire Pushing for reregulation 
of electricity conflicts with the partys basic tenet of less government 
interference Conversely arguing for full deregulation puts Republicans at 
odds with a solid majority of Californians 
A Los Angeles Times poll taken Feb  found that  percent of 
Californians want to go back to a regulated electricity industry while  
percent are opposed 
The GOP problem is exacerbated because there is no easy policy solution to 
the energy mess said Jack Pitney government professor at Claremont McKenna 
College Its difficult to see how we get out of this situation without 
considerable cost If there were a silver bullet somebody would have found 
it by now 
Republicans have attacked Davis for his plan to buy power lines from private 
utilities Everybody agrees theres  billion or  billion in deferred 
maintenance said GOP consultant Sal Russo another speaker at the partys 
convention today We need to be in this business like a hole in the head 
But the Times poll found that Californians by a  margin favor the 
idea Moreover Davis job approval rating has climbed this year In January 
 percent approved and  percent disapproved In February it was up to 
 Californians give Davis better marks for handling the electricity 
crisis than they give President Bush 
Republicans are going to have difficult time laying the political blame on 
Davis Its Murder on the Orient Express Everybody did it Pitney said 
Although you can make a case that Davis was slow in reacting no one can 
seriously pin him with the primary blame for the problem 
The deregulation bill passed the Legislature in  with the strong support 
of both parties and a Republican governor Pete Wilson Senate Minority 
Leader Jim Brulte RRancho Cucamonga is considered one of the Republican 
Partys top strategists He was also one of the leading proponents of the 
deregulation bill 
For all of those reasons Garry South Davis political strategist said he 
does not fear a GOP attack on electricity If the Republicans want to get 
into a fullout firefight over how this mess came about Im more than 
willing to play They dont have a very good story to tell 
For now Davis political strength is stable But the  primary elections 
are still more than a year away and the general election is a political 
eternity from now 
If this isnt resolved there is nothing to guarantee that there wont be a 
voter backlash against the government said political analyst Sherry Bebitch 
Jeffe And right now the government in California is the Democratic Party 
Thats the message the Republicans want to drive home But if they cant come 
up with their own alternative they might have a hard time playing the blame 
game



Davis says state has tentative deal for Edison grid 


Updated Feb     pm 
LOS ANGELES  After a week of intense closeddoor negotiations with utility 
representatives Gov Gray Davis said Friday he had reached an agreement in 
principle with Southern California Edison to buy the utilitys power lines 
for an estimated  billion 

The deal also requires Edison International the parent company of Edison to 
sell cheap power to the state for a decade 

This is the framework of a good balanced deal Davis said Its not a 
final deal Theres a lot of work to be done But were making progress 

The governor said he did not expect customer rates to increase as a result of 
the deal 

Edison did not immediately return calls seeking comment 

The state has been in talks for a week to buy a total of  miles of 
transmission lines from Edison Pacific Gas and Electric and Sempra Energy 
which operates San Diego Gas  Electric The total cost of the lines could 
range from  billion to  billion 

The effort is intended to help restore the financial health of the states 
two largest utilities PGE and Edison both of which are near bankruptcy 
The  billion price for the Edison lines amounts to  times the 
estimated book value Davis said 

The utilities say they have lost nearly  billion since June trapped 
between soaring wholesale power prices and stateimposed rate caps for 
consumers The tentative plan announced by Davis would allow Edison to issue 
bonds for a substantial portion of its losses 

Davis said the state is making good progress in its talks with Sempra and 
some progress with PGE Thursday Davis said he will not sign off on any 
grid buyout without all three utilities participation 

I do not believe we can make a satisfactory arrangement without  percent 
of the transmission grid and that would require cooperation with PGE he 
said Friday 

PGE spokesman Ron Low said Thursday night that talks had ended with no 
resolution that day 

These are complicated problems that will not be solved overnight Low said 
There are clearly some issues where we are very far apart 

Still PGE chief executive officer Robert Glynn Jr said Friday the meeting 
with Davis was a milestone in the resolution of Californias energy crisis 
and said he was willing to meet further to discuss the utilitys proposal 

Each utilitys issues and opportunities in this crisis are different and we 
believe that PGE has proposed a detailed solution that balances ratepayer 
and shareholder interests Glynn said in a statement issued Friday before 
the governors news conference 

The company said it would have no further comment 

The tentative agreement also calls for 

Edison parent Edison International to make payments to the utility of about 
 million 
Edison International to commit the entire output of its Sunrise Mission power 
project at low costbased rates for  years Davis said that arrangement 
could save ratepayers  million over the next two years 
Edison to provide costbased rates from generating plants it owns for another 
 years 
Edison to drop its lawsuit against the California Public Utilities Commission 
claiming that imposed rate caps were illegal under federal law 

This entire transaction which I believe is fair and balanced for both 
sides will be accomplished within the existing rate structure Davis said 
We will not be asking any more of consumers to allow this transaction to 
come to pass 

Davis said negotiations will continue in the coming days 

Consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield called the governors plan an outrageous 
giveaway and predicted that if lawmakers didnt halt it voters would 
revolt 

The most outrageous part of this isnt even paying  times what the lines 
are worth but then allowing the parent companies that siphoned off billions 
of dollars to pay only the tax payment they already owe Rosenfield said 

The Public Utilities Commission already regulates how much the utilities can 
charge for power their own plants generate Rosenfield said

Utilities Search for LongTerm Fix During Breather
State purchase of power lines under discussion 

FridayFebruary   
 San Francisco Chronicle 
Sacramento  A break in the weather and a break in the energy crisis 
coincided yesterday as California enjoyed its first day in more than a month 
without a power alert 
With the shortterm picture for power improving representatives of the 
states three troubled utilities met separately with Gov Gray Davis and his 
staff to work on a longerrange fix for the power crisis that would include 
state purchase of the firms transmission lines Trouble loomed in at least 
one set of talks however as Pacific Gas and Electric Co said it was very 
far from reaching a deal 
The California Independent System Operator which coordinates the flow of 
electricity through the states power grid removed all power alerts at about 
 am yesterday Spokeswoman Lorie ODonley said that with springtime 
approaching and weather improving and with some power plants coming back to 
full output from maintenance the overall picture is brightening 
Were optimistic she said Were coming into the spring season the 
majority of generators have had their maintenance completed But everything 
is dependent on the weather and temperature 
The last day California had no power alerts was Jan  Since then there 
have been two days of rolling blackouts in Northern California and many other 
days of Stage  alerts  when power reserves dip below  percent of 
available capacity 
The mildest alert Stage  is declared when reserves are between  and  
percent of capacity 
The supply of power has been helped by warmer temperatures in other Western 
states cutting demand there and by an increase in generators on line in 
California ODonley said 
Last week when the state was still in Stage  alerts  megawatts were 
offline in California Yesterday there were  megawatts offline a 
difference that provides enough power for a couple million homes 
ODonley warned that the supply picture in California is still tight and 
conservation still necessary But the focus of attention was turning to 
Sacramento and Davis talks with the utilities 
Davis announced a plan last week for the state to purchase  miles of 
utilityowned transmission lines in exchange for backing bonds that allow the 
utilities to repay the almost  billion in debt they say they owe 
While Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric have 
indicated willingness to sell their lines PGE has refused to comment on the 
proposal 
It is not clear if PGE is unwilling to sell or simply trying to strike a 
harder bargain The utility had accumulated more debt than its Southern 
California counterparts and also owns the largest part of the transmission 
line grid 
Talks between Davis staff and PGE did not start until late yesterday 
afternoon and indications were that they were more difficult than 
negotiations involving the other two utilities 
Theyre just on a different page Michael Peevey the former Edison 
president who is Davis chief negotiator told Bloomberg News 
PGE spokesman Ron Low said These are difficult problems that cannot be 
solved overnight There are clearly some areas where we are very far apart 
Davis hopes to make an announcement with at least one of the utilities before 
leaving today for the fourday National Governors Association meeting in 
Washington DC 
The union that represents some  PGE employees meanwhile called on 
Davis to negotiate state ownership of two power plants under construction in 
which PGE holds large stakes 
Jack McNally business manager of the International Brotherhood of Electrical 
Workers Local  in Walnut Creek told Davis in a letter that a 
transmission line takeover would be a grand experiment fraught with danger 
Acquiring the two prospective power plants in Kern and San Diego counties 
would do more to address energy shortages than taking over transmission lines 
that need hundreds of millions of dollars in maintenance union officials 
said 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio countered that state acquisition of 
transmission lines would not affect one union job as the state would 
simply lease the grid back to the utilities Maviglio predicted union jobs 
would increase with investment in new capacity and system upgrades

States energy price tag increases 
Published Friday Feb   in the San Jose Mercury News 
BY DION NISSENBAUM 

Mercury News Sacramento Bureau 


SACRAMENTO  Californias energy crisis took another big bite out of the 
state budget Thursday when finance aides to Gov Gray Davis announced that 
the cost of buying energy may top  billion by midMarch 
In a move that raised new alarms for lawmakers the governors finance team 
for the third time this month asked for  million to buy electricity in 
the coming weeks while Davis tries to work out a deal to bail out the states 
nearbankrupt utilities That combined with money spent last month to buy 
energy could drain the state coffers of  billion by St Patricks Day 
The request for more cash came on the same day that California spent its 
first day in weeks without an official energy emergency and Davis held 
critical talks with the heads of Pacific Gas  Electric Co and San Diego Gas 
 Electric Co The talks are aimed at rescuing the two companies and Southern 
California Edison from financial collapse 
While Davis had expressed hope last week of working out a deal by today 
sources said that an agreement still remains elusive 
Until a compromise can be hammered out the state is being forced to pay 
upward of  million a day from the general fund to buy electricity 
State leaders expect that the money will eventually be repaid to the general 
fund under a  billion bond package But lawmakers are growing increasingly 
concerned about the shortterm impact on the state fiscal plan 
Assemblywoman Carole Migden DSan Francisco said the latest request for 
more money could create greater concern and anxiety among lawmakers and 
added that the energy crisis was going to make it harder to fund other 
programs such as support for abused children 
Its going to be a bleak year for other budget priorities said Migden 
who is chairwoman of the powerful Assembly Appropriations Committee 
Earlier this week the states independent financial analyst warned that the 
energy crisis could eat into state money the governor wants to spend on other 
things such as the environment and public safety 
While lawmakers have so far bitten their tongues about the growing power 
price tag Migden said the Legislature might be hesitant to allow the costs 
to go any higher 
I cant imagine another infusion after this being required Migden said 
I think this has to be the last request because were going to hit 
fundamental core programs 
Waiting for bailout plan 
California stepped in to buy the energy last month after PGE and Southern 
California Edison lost the financial wherewithal to do it themselves At the 
time state leaders reluctantly agreed to buy the energy for a short period 
of time as part of a larger plan for California to sign longterm contracts 
with power generators 
But those negotiations have failed to produce much energy so far and Davis 
said earlier this week that the power producers are hesitant to sign any 
deals until California agrees to a bailout plan for the utilities On 
Thursday one power producer  Williams Cos  announced that it had signed 
a year contract with the state to provide up to  megawatts of power 
to California 
In a bid to work out the bailout plan Davis and his advisers met Thursday 
and were to meet again today with top executives from all three electric 
utilities in financial trouble The Democratic governor wants to buy  
miles of high voltage transmission lines owned by the three companies in 
exchange for helping the utilities pay off  billion in debts The 
utilities are being asked to protect thousands of acres of wilderness lands 
they own hang onto power plants that provide the state with its cheapest 
electricity and drop explosive lawsuits that could allow the companies to 
dramatically raise customer rates 
But sources said talks have bogged down on the transmission line deal which 
PGE has been reluctant to accept 
Alternative energy helps out 
While talks slogged along in the governors office state lawmakers announced 
that another key piece of the puzzle needed to solve the energy crisis was 
falling into place 
State Sen Jim Battin RPalm Desert and Assemblyman Fred Keeley DSanta 
Cruz said that alternative energy producers had agreed to dramatically lower 
their prices in a deal that could save California  billion to  billion 
Those energy producers nearly  wind solar and natural gasfired plants 
provide about a third of the states energy


Paying for power still a big question
POWER CRISIS 
PGE doesnt like the plan the PUC proposed to collect electricity costs 
By Mike Taugher
TIMES STAFF WRITER 
Three weeks after Gov Gray Davis signed into law the states centerpiece for 
stabilizing energy costs big differences remain over how the solutions will 
be implemented and who will pay for them 
The plan outlined in legislation known as ABX was intended first to stop 
the financial bleeding of Californias two largest utilities by asking the 
state to buy enough unsecured power to keep the lights on Next the state 
would enter longterm contracts for less expensive power that would 
eventually lessen the need for more costly lastminute electricity 
But the state has balked at buying the entire portfolio of lastminute 
electricity that is needed and a disagreement emerged Thursday over what 
portion of consumers bills should be used to reimburse state coffers 
Meanwhile progress on completing contracts has been slow although two were 
signed Thursday 
A spokesman for Davis said more contracts for relatively lowcost power would 
be signed once the state bought the utilities transmission lines and other 
assets because then the utilities could pay their pastdue bills The 
governor said last week that he expected a deal with the utilities by today 
but that might not happen 
Clearly theres been challenges getting longterm contracts but weve 
turned the corner said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio Weve got three in 
the bank and  more once we get these deals with the utilities done 
Also Thursday the Public Utilities Commission was poised to allow the state 
to collect the entire amount that customers pay specifically for electricity 
But Pacific Gas  Electric Co said it is entitled to deduct other costs from 
customers payments before reimbursing the state That would reduce payments 
from PGE to the state by about half according to the company 
The PUC proposal was in response to a request from the state Department of 
Water Resources that it be allowed to start collecting money so that energy 
companies would be more willing to sell power to the agency 
The two Republicanappointed commissioners of the PUC blocked the move which 
needed four of five commissioners approval to reach the agenda 
DWRs action is exacerbating a problem ABX was meant to alleviate said 
Commissioner Richard Bilas It is pushing the utilities closer to 
bankruptcy 
PGE spokesman John Nelson said the proposal brought by PUC President Loretta 
Lynch would have been unfair to the utilities because ABX allows them to 
deduct expenses for buying electricity and generating energy at their own 
power plants before reimbursing the state 
All of those costs need to be paid going forward Otherwise you still leave 
the utilities to bleed Nelson said 
That stance appeared to be at odds with the office of Assemblyman Fred 
Keeley the Boulder Creek Democrat who wrote ABX 
For PGE to think it can keep money for electrons it never even owned is 
astounding to us said Guy Phillips a Keeley aide 
While nothing has gone smoothly Phillips and others expressed optimism that 
the states biggest effort to date to fix the energy crisis would work 
We think those will be sorted out said Phillips who acknowledged there 
has been much confusion about what lawmakers intended in ABX 
For example Keeleys office said lawmakers wanted the water resources agency 
to make up the entire amount of electricity that the states two largest 
utilities had not secured ahead of time The high cost of this lastminute 
electricity  and the utilities heavy reliance on it  is what drove PGE 
and Southern California Edison to the brink of bankruptcy 
But the water agency has balked at buying electricity offered at prices it 
calls unreasonable While state officials have refused to say how much 
electricity it has left to utilities to purchase the state is paying about 
 million a day to keep electricity flowing 
And that amounts to about  percent of the electricity purchased on behalf 
of the utilities on the same day it is needed according to Phillips 
The states reluctance to buy all of the socalled realtime electricity has 
led to fears that the utilities will continue to run up debt and that power 
companies will not collect money owed to them That dispute has landed in 
federal court where a Sacramento judge is forcing three major power 
suppliers and a marketing company to continue selling power in the state 
If a settlement is not reached today US District Judge Frank C Damrell is 
expected to decide whether to extend his order to modify it or to drop it

Lowenthal returns utility money 

By Will Shuck
From our Sacramento Bureau 

SACRAMENTO Assemblyman Alan Lowenthal DLong Beach this week joined a small 
group of legislators who returned campaign contributions to California 
utility companies and other energy firms 

He sent  back to Southern California Edison and  to Sempra Energy 
parent company of Southern California Gas It was a small portion of the more 
than Lowenthal  Lowenthal had raised in  for his reelection 
campaign 
He said he returned the money as did nine other Assembly members at the 
urging of the consumer advocacy group Global Exchange 
We think its fantastic that he has recognized that in the eyes of the 
public there is a very serious potential conflict of interest said group 
spokeswoman Medea Benjamin We applaud him for wanting to ensure the 
integrity of the legislative process 
While Benjamin says its critical that lawmakers not be tainted by energy 
money during the states power crisis others wonder where the line should be 
drawn 
In the real world of politics it costs money to run for office and you have 
to get that money somewhere said Paul Schmidt a political science 
professor at Cal State Long Beach To say that you can only make decisions 
on things involving individuals that havent given you any money would result 
in paralysis of government 
Benjamin and other consumer advocates say the power crisis calls for special 
consideration 
There are not many cases in which theyre actually voting whether a company 
will survive with billions of dollars of taxpayer money or go bankrupt as 
theyre doing with the utility companies Benjamin said 
Lowenthal agreed I thought it was an appropriate request he said These 
are unique circumstances and I just think its in the publics best interest 
that I return that money


Dan Walters A power grab by politicians 


Published Feb   
Slowly but inexorably control over the generation acquisition and 
distribution of electric power in California is being shifted from 
professional utility managers and independent regulators into the hands of 
politicians 
The  utility deregulation scheme enacted by the Legislature was an 
initial foray into politicization Legislation granting the governor more 
control over the makeup of the Public Utilities Commission was another But 
the current power supply price crisis has led to even more direct political 
influence over  or interference with  electric service One hastily 
enacted bill for example gives the governor direct control of the 
nowmisnamed Independent System Operator which operates the statewide 
power grid 
More political intrusion is in the works from a state takeover of the 
intercity power transmission grid to the creation of a state power authority 
that would buy generate and sell electricity directly And while local 
public utilities function well a state power agency might operate on the 
whims of professional politicians The Legislature for example wants 
appointments to the board that would direct a state power authority and big 
state power projects would be subject to the same kind of porkbarrel 
mentality that distorts other public works appropriations Where power plants 
were to be built or where highvoltage lines would be strung might well 
depend on who could and could not bring political influence to bear rather 
than what the system needed to work efficiently 
Clues to the potential pitfalls of a stateoperated power system are found in 
the approaches of Capitol politicians to the current crisis There is for 
example the unspoken goal of avoiding big power rate boosts until after the 
November  election  even if it means running up billions of dollars in 
debts to do it Would future rates charged by a state power authority be 
raised or lowered to enhance the prospects of the dominant party or an 
incumbent governor Theres no evidence in past performances to indicate they 
wouldnt be 
And then theres the knotty question of who would get vital power supplies in 
the event of shortages  a situation that is already looming and could 
become worse in future months 
Emergency legislation already gives the state the right to sell power as it 
pleases without competitive bidding or even public notice Theres nothing 
really to prevent politically influential power customers such as big 
industrial enterprises from cutting their own supply deals with politically 
directed state officials 
And whose juice would be cut off if shortages mean blackouts Approximately 
 percent of current power customers are effectively exempt from rolling 
blackouts because they are connected to circuits called blocks that also 
include vital services such as hospitals fire and police agencies water 
supply systems and communications centers The Capitol not surprisingly is 
in one of those noninterruptible blocks 
With the threat of further blackouts looming legislation is being drafted to 
designate which customers will suffer and which will not  thus taking that 
authority out of the hands of utilities and regulators And that in turn is 
generating pressure from lobbyists from all sorts of interest groups to place 
their clients on protected lists Should farmers be cut off or biotechnology 
facilities or computer chip plants or schools 
When politicians control any process or system one can be certain that they 
will always make expedient political decisions regardless of the longterm 
or wider consequences Thus we may someday regret allowing the Capitols 
selfserving politicians to get their hands on our electric power system


Discount Urged Near Power Plants
Senator urges electricity rate break for neighbors of generators 

FridayFebruary   
 San Francisco Chronicle 
As California officials propose building  new peaker power plants across 
the state by July one legislator from plantrich eastern Contra Costa County 
thinks residents should get a discount on their power bill for having a 
generator in their backyard 
The proposed bill would provide a little payback for residents of state Sen 
Tom Torlaksons district which is home to a halfdozen plants and has three 
more in the construction pipeline 
Under the bill introduced yesterday by Torlakson DAntioch people living 
within a mile circle around a power plant would receive a  percent 
discount on their electricity bill and be exempt from blackouts 
The legislation was partially inspired by San Jose officials rejecting a 
proposal to build a megawatt power plant in the Coyote Valley as well as 
Gov Gray Davis plan to build  megawatts of new generating capacity by 
July  
Its a question of fairness Torlakson said People in communities who are 
shouldering the burden for having plants in their backyard should get some 
benefit from it 
Torlakson said consumers who lived in communities without plants could pick 
up the tab for the discounts But the utilities would have to figure that 
out within their rate system he said 
A PGE spokesman said yesterday that the company does not comment on pending 
legislation 
While consumer advocates environmentalists and power generators were 
lukewarm to the proposal yesterday many admit that the state has not thought 
about how to  of even if they have to  offer communities a little 
incentive to approve a power plant within their borders However the state 
has allocated  million for plants that get online by July  
As far as incentives Id think most communities would see the value of the 
employment theyd get and the increase to the tax base said Larry Hamlin 
the governors recently appointed project manager for the plantbuilding 
campaign 
A spokesman for Californias Environmental Protection Agency which permits 
plants said the plan might be a worthwhile idea for making power plants 
more palatable to Californians 
Michael Shames head of Utility Consumer Action Network in San Diego said the 
bill was attacking a not in my back yard problem that doesnt exist Many 
San Diego communities are clamoring for plants in the hope that they would 
bring stability to the market he said 
James Peters of Mirent the Atlantabased company formerly known as Southern 
Energy said the plan wouldnt encourage generators to build the number of 
plants needed to solve the energy crisis 
Already communities like Pittsburg have cut deals with power generators 
before letting them build In exchange for letting the Calpine Corp build 
two large plants in town Pittsburg received the lifetime option to purchase 
 megawatts of power at belowmarket rates 
Next week a Pittsburg group is going to begin gathering signatures demanding 
that city leaders use the estimated  megawatts it would take to light 
residences and businesses to give local residents a break on bills The group 
will hold an organizational meeting at  pm Tuesday at the Los Medanos 
Community Hospital  Loveridge Rd in Pittsburg


At last power alerts are lifted Enjoy respite because crisis far from 
resolved experts say
By Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writer
Published Feb   
As oddly as it arrived Californias electric emergency lifted Thursday 
morning 
At  am the Independent System Operator which controls most of 
Californias grid ended a Stage  alert 
It was the first time since Jan  that the state hadnt been under a power 
emergency declared when low supplies threaten grid stability The alerts 
included  straight days of Stage  emergencies the black clouds that 
gather before rotating outages 
The clouds cleared on a day when predicted peak use was low  but not the 
lowest it has been for the last five weeks Many power plants were back on 
line after repairs  but more plants had been operating during at least one 
Stage  day 
So what happened 
A little luck a little planning and maybe a little group psychology said 
those who have closely watched recent gyrations of the states electric 
roller coaster 
It is a roll of the dice said Gary Ackerman head of the Western Power 
Trading Forum which represents plant owners and marketers If it continues 
for the next three or four weeks I wouldnt be too surprised Thatll be our 
respite Enjoy it 
The end of a day string of emergencies could mean a few more lights in 
store aisles or a little less worry about running an electric furnace Some 
speculated it might also mean lower wholesale prices 
But major changes are not likely in the steady rain of conservation calls 
that have fallen on Californians since the north state was twice plunged into 
rotating blackouts last month 
I hope people dont just go back to wasteful ways said Mike Florio of The 
Utility Reform Network a consumer group 
Now that the emergencies have dissipated we dont have to talk about 
imposing hardships on people but prudent use of energy is an idea were 
going to have to live with for a long time he said 
At the ISO longer days and slightly warmer weather was credited with 
decreasing peak demand for electricity Supplies are up within the state and 
power imports from the Pacific Northwest have risen significantly said Jim 
Detmers who manages grid operations 
Plus in one of the biggest changes the state Department of Water Resources 
has begun getting more power supplies lined up at least a day in advance he 
said 
Since the department stepped in to buy power on behalf of cashstrapped 
utilities it has often managed to line up about  percent to  percent of 
what the state needed to supplement utilitycontrolled supplies according to 
Detmers That meant grid operators had to scramble to buy the rest on very 
short notice 
But starting last Friday the state began to schedule about  percent of its 
purchases at least one day in advance 
The operators are able to enter a day with a lot more confidence about being 
able to make it Detmers said You dont have to search to find those 
megawatts at the last minute 
Closely in sync with increased purchases by the state the ISO dropped from a 
Stage  emergency to Stage  on Friday and then slid to a Stage  Wednesday 
The stages are based on how much reserve power is left for unexpected crises 
a Stage  is declared when reserves slip below  percent 
For their part power buyers at the water resources department werent sure 
what has made the difference over the past few days 
Its certainly not that people are lining up to sell us power at cheap 
prices said Jim Spence the departments director of emergency operations 
Were just buying whatever we can and it turned out that it was easier to 
make ends meet 
He said he couldnt make any prediction about how long that would last 
The string of power emergencies has been unpredictable from the start 
erupting in winter when Californias hunger for electricity traditionally 
declines and supplies are usually so flush that plants close for tuneups 
Consumer advocates and power traders blamed finances for the emergencies 
rather than a fundamental lack of supply as fears of utility bankruptcies 
triggered a descent into market chaos and highstakes political maneuvering 
But basic supply shortages are expected to move to the forefront by summer 
when temperatures rise and demand soars 
Meanwhile the brief respite  whatever the reason  brought palpable 
relief to those charged with keeping the power grid stable 
When we found out yesterday during the board meeting that we were only in 
Stage  we broke out in applause said Florio who sits on the fivemember 
ISO board 
The change also could be good news for consumers who may one day be paying 
higher rates for the wholesale electricity now being purchased by the state 
Getting out of a Stage  typically means prices are going to ease Florio 
said When youre even in a Stage  thats a signal to everybody Theyre 
short that means we can hold them up now  


Davis deadlines on energy much easier set than met
By Emily Bazar
Bee Staff Writer
Published Feb   
Exactly one week ago Gov Gray Davis sounded hopeful optimistic even when 
he predicted that the state and its debtridden utilities would forge an 
agreement by today on a plan to save the companies from financial doom 
Problem is it wont work out that way 
Negotiations between state officials and the investorowned utilities have 
produced no comprehensive agreement to announce today 
Davis predictions during the energy crisis have been wrong before 
For weeks he has set deadlines for agreements and legislative action that 
havent been met On deadline days even when theres little substantive 
progress to report Davis often holds news conferences anyway  many of them 
on Friday afternoons after financial markets close 
The Democratic governors office scheduled an announcement for today in Los 
Angeles even though one utility representative said agreement is far away 
Davis actions have fueled speculation that hes trying to force consensus by 
setting artificial deadlines and putting a spin on the news and tarnishing 
the states credibility in the process 
I cant see how you would negotiate such a complex deal like the purchase 
of the transmission grid in such a short period of time It doesnt seem 
realistic said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum an 
association of wholesale generators I guess the people I represent have 
turned it off They have stopped listening They hear it and say OK sure 
Heres another photo op  
Last Friday Davis told a gathering of reporters that state officials and the 
utilities would agree by today on a rescue plan for the utilities 
I believe well have agreement before next week is out on exactly what 
should go in a piece of legislation he said at the time And hopefully 
that legislation will be passed by the end of the following week 
Legislative veterans said his comments were illadvised and unrealistic 
Davis met into the night Thursday with top officials of Pacific Gas and 
Electric Co but no agrement was reached 
These are complicated problems that will not be solved overnight said PGE 
spokesman Ron Low On some issues we are very far away from agreement 
Sources said PGE has been unwilling to negotiate sale of its transmission 
lines which Davis has said is a necessary component of a deal More progress 
was reported with the two other nearbankrupt companies  San Diego Gas and 
Electric Co and Southern California Edison  although sources said talks 
with them were far from concluded 
Davis has been setting specific deadlines for himself and the Legislature for 
months 
In November the governor promised to present a comprehensive plan by Dec 
 to stave off a fullblown energy crisis but ended up offering only a 
modest slate of proposals 
Davis called Feb  a drop dead date by which he hoped to cement a deal 
between lawmakers and the utilities Theres no deal yet 
Davis told reporters that he and the states legislative leaders would reach 
a consensus agreement on the proposal to take to utilities by last Friday 
It didnt happen he made the announcement alone 
Leon Panetta a White House chief of staff under former President Clinton 
said its important that the governor set deadlines because the nature of 
politics is to delay 
However he cautioned against missing deadlines 
You have to be careful that you keep the deadlines you establish because 
the more that you establish and not meet the more that begins to lose its 
value as a political tool Panetta said 
The governor cant continue to indefinitely set deadlines without facing 
consequences cautioned Steven Fetter managing director of the Global Power 
Group at Fitch a creditrating agency based in New York 
At some point he warned creditors and power suppliers may push the 
utilities into involuntary bankruptcy which would trigger an official 
deadline that cant be ignored The dispute would be tied up in court at a 
judges discretion 
Eventually there is going to be a real deadline Fetter said The problem 
is its probably not a deadline that will be set by Gov Davis Its a 
deadline that will be set by the banks and the electricity suppliers 
In several cases when deadlines havent been met Davis has held a news 
conference regardless unveiling little new information and scant detail 
On Jan  for instance the governor promoted the broad framework of a plan 
to save the utilities rather than a detailed plan that had been anticipated 
One prong of the plan Aggressively promote energy efficiency conservation 
and demand reduction among consumers businesses and public entities 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said that the governor continues to set 
deadlines because its important to show that the state is making progress 
particularly to Wall Street 
He added that its not the governors fault the deadlines have been missed 
Many of the dates have been blown away by factors no one has been able to 
foresee or have control over court decisions actions by creditors weather 
you name it Maviglio said The governor sets deadlines that continue to 
move the ball forward and he has been successful at doing that 
Many of these announcements came after  pm on Fridays triggering 
suggestions that the governor has attempted to spin the facts and manipulate 
the markets 
Timing announcements after the close of East Coast financial markets is 
commonly used by politicians who dont want to send stocks soaring or 
tumbling by making an announcement Panetta said 
You want people to evaluate whats happening so there isnt a panic reaction 
to a news flash going over the wire he said 
But market analysts say that ever since PGE and Edison stocks plummeted in 
early January the governors statements havent significantly affected their 
performance 
There has been so much news that has been so negative for the companies that 
I dont think it makes much of a difference said Ed Schuller a senior vice 
president for the fullservice brokerage firm Sutro  Co Its beyond that 
point now 


GOP Sees Power Crisis as Davis Achilles Heel
Republicans line up to run for governor 

FridayFebruary   
 San Francisco Chronicle 
Democratic Gov Gray Davis politically wounded by the states power woes 
has become the target of a growing pack of Republicans looking to turn him 
out of office 
Four months ago Davis looked on track to get reelected by a voice vote 
said Dan Schnur a GOP strategist But the energy crisis has exposed 
vulnerabilities that have encouraged others to look at the  governors 
race 
The governors backers however are confident California voters will 
recognize Davis is dealing with a problem that has been brewing for years 
through previous Republican administrations 
If the Republicans want to have a fullout firefight over who brought this 
energy crisis down were ready for it said Garry South the governors 
top political adviser Its a fight they cant win 
With the primary election still more than a year away no one but Davis is a 
sure bet to leap into the contest but at least three names will be 
circulating when California Republicans meet in Sacramento this weekend for 
their state convention 
Secretary of State Bill Jones Los Angeles investor Bill Simon Jr and actor 
Arnold Schwarzenegger all have made noises about challenging Davis but so 
far their incipient campaigns have been more talk than action 
Simons effort might be the farthest along but he also has the longest way 
to travel A political unknown the yearold Simon runs his familys 
investment company and has been active in a number of charitable 
organizations in Southern California 
Simon whose father was treasury secretary under President Richard Nixon has 
brought in veteran GOP consultant Sal Russo to study a possible run for 
governor 
Bill Simon feels we need a governor whos prepared to lead and not one whos 
focused on fundraising or the next political office Russo said in a jab at 
Davis 
Simon was an assistant US attorney in New York but founded William E 
Simon  Sons with his brother and late father in  The  billion private 
investment firm owns a number of companies and has also invested heavily in 
South of Market real estate in San Francisco 
Wealthy political outsiders dont have an enviable record in recent 
California elections Republican Michael Huffington spent  million to lose 
a  Senate race to Dianne Feinstein Darrell Issa dropped around  
million in a losing race for the  GOP Senate nomination Al Checchi spent 
about  million of his own money to lose the Democratic primary to Davis in 
 
While Simon likely would be spending plenty of his own money on a governors 
bid hes working to get outside support both political and financial 
before committing to the race Russo said 
With the states problems mounting and the economy increasingly shaky the 
time may be ripe for a political unknown he added 
When things start going bad people are willing to look outside for a new 
face someone who will get things done Russo said 
Jones is anything but a political outsider A veteran legislator from the 
Fresno area he is now serving his second and last term as Californias 
secretary of state He managed to hang onto his job during the GOPs  
electoral debacle which cost the party every other constitutional office 
While Jones has long talked about a run for governor hes still playing coy 
We have not made any decision and probably wont make one until early 
March said Rob Lapsley one of Jones top advisers Right now were 
putting together information for Bill to make a decision 
While Jones role as the states top GOP officeholder makes him an obvious 
choice to challenge Davis hes made a number of political enemies over the 
years many of them in his own party His surprise decision last year to 
switch his support from George W Bush to Arizona Sen John McCain in 
Californias presidential primary won him no fans among Bush supporters and 
could hurt his attempts to raise money for a gubernatorial bid 
Money is a major problem for Jones who listed  in his campaign fund 
last month compared with nearly  million for Davis Some of his opponents 
have suggested that fundraising woes may force Jones to run for an office 
other than governor 
Right now were focused on the governors race Lapsley insisted 
The real Republican wild card is Schwarzenegger the movie action hero who 
would be instantly recognized by nearly every California voter 
While Schwarzeneggers publicist told The Chronicle last month that he had no 
plans to get involved in next years governors race the Austrianborn star 
was on the telephone to a Los Angeles Times columnist days later talking 
about his love for politics and his political ambitions 
Fame however has its drawbacks as the yearold Schwarzenegger has 
found An article in Premiere magazine entitled Arnold the Barbarian 
accused him of groping women on movie sets and generally boorish behavior 
while the supermarket tabloids have him on the cover this week suggesting 
that his marriage to Maria Shriver is on the rocks 
South Davis political adviser gleefully sent copies of the Premiere 
article to reporters across the state suggesting that the piece lays out a 
real touching story  if you get what I mean 
Whoever ends up with the GOP nomination still will face an uphill battle 
against Davis a popular governor and a take no prisoners campaigner 
Ive been predicting since Day One that the GOP would find some moneybags 
candidate to throw against Gray South said Thats why weve kept our 
political and fundraising operation going since election day


Pressure Is on Utilities to Accept Grid Sale 

Energy Gov Davis wants accord today but Edison executive says company 
might prefer bankruptcy 

By DAN MORAIN and NANCY VOGEL Times Staff Writers 

SACRAMENTOHis credibility at risk and Californias energy future on 
the line Gov Gray Davis on Thursday turned up the heat on the states 
utilities to accept today a series of tentative rescue accords that would put 
the companies transmission systems into public hands
How far the utilities are willing to bend to the governors intensified 
pressure was unclear late Thursday Given Davis mandate a top executive of 
Southern California Edison said his company is now being forced to seriously 
contemplate whether it might fare better in Bankruptcy Court
We are weighing two very unpalatable alternatives he said
Two alternatives facing the utilities are either to sell their 
electrical transmission systems to the state at a price they consider too low 
or gamble in Bankruptcy Court that they could hang onto their valuable assets
After nearly a week of negotiations Davis administration officials said 
they hoped to announce today a partial deal that would calm the utilities 
jittery creditors and help subdue Californias runaway electricity market
State officials said Thursday they were close to agreements with Edison 
and San Diego Gas  Electric but remained at odds with the states biggest 
utility Pacific Gas  Electric which has balked at giving up its 
transmission grid
These are complex issues that cannot be resolved overnight said PGE 
spokesman Ron Lowe There are clearly some areas where we are very far 
apart
On Thursday Edison Chairman John Bryson conferred with members of his 
utilitys board of directors But by evening the companys top executives 
still had not decided whether to acknowledge that an agreement is near
Although the utility has begun to contemplate the protections of 
bankruptcy it is unclear when or if such a dramatic action would occur
Davis is believed to be offering roughly  billion for the utilities 
transmission grids The companies could use the cash to restructure their 
debt which resulted from the utilities inability to pass along their 
soaring wholesale electricity costs to ratepayers
Davis has significant political and fiscal reasons for wanting to make 
an announcement today He is scheduled to arrive in Washington for the 
National Governors Assn conference this weekend meet with US Energy 
Secretary Spencer Abraham on Sunday and attend the Democratic Governors 
Assn annual fundraising dinner Monday night
Davis a prodigious fundraiser is chairman of the Democratic Governors 
Assn and the dinner is expected to raise more than  million Of that 
amount Davis political organization raised in excess of  million said 
Garry South his chief political advisor
Any progress Davis can cite could help improve his national political 
standing But his aides say its especially important to be able to show at 
least a semblance of an agreement when he travels to New York on Wednesday to 
confer with Wall Street analysts
On Thursday those analysts reacted exuberantly to early hints from the 
governors office that settlements with the utilities might be announced
The recently anemic stocks of Edison International and PGE Corp soared 
on the New York Stock Exchange on a day when most utility stocks closed lower
Edison jumped  per share or  to close at  while PGE 
gained  or  to  per share
That suggests that someone thinks something good is happening in 
Sacramento said analyst James D von Riesemann of Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter  Co
But some analysts fear investor enthusiasm might be hasty
Im concerned that the governors optimism may not coincide with all 
the parties at the table and it may not coincide with the Legislature said 
Paul Patterson utility analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston Corp
Davis met Thursday with Steve Baum chairman of Sempra the parent 
company of SDGE Administration officials are confident that an agreement 
can be reached But the San Diego company is the smallest of the states 
three major private utilities and its debt is far smaller million 
compared to the combined  billion that Edison and PGE say they have 
amassed
Baum is willing to listen said Sempra spokesman Doug Kline     
Were on the record as stating that we are willing to consider the sale of 
those transmission assets if it helps solve the crisis
PGE executives had been scheduled to start meeting with Davis at  
am Thursday But in what was seen a slight against PGE Davis aides did 
not summon negotiators for the Northern California utility including company 
Chairman Robert Glynn until after 
Although the parties continued to wrangle over details there was 
progress Thursday on the sidelines 
State officials announced they had signed a longterm contract for a 
relatively small amount of electricity with a major energy supplieran 
achievement that was perhaps more symbolic than substantive
Tulsabased Williams Cos said it had agreed to a year deal to sell 
power to the Department of Water Resources By April the company will 
provide at least  megawattsenough electricity to supply  
homesat times of the day when demand for electricity soars Such peak 
supplies will increase through next summer and reach  megawatts by  
according to Williams
The agreement is only the second such longterm contract since Davis 
signed a bill Feb  putting the Department of Water Resources into the 
powerbuying business for many years to come
At least  other power suppliers have reached understandings with the 
state Davis said Wednesday But those companies refuse to sign deals the 
governor said until the state finds a way to help Californias two biggest 
utilities pay off their billiondollar debts
As soon as we revitalize the utilities the governor said I think 
youll see a lot of movement on longterm contracts
Another small but important piece of the states energy plan emerged 
Thursday when legislation was introduced by Sen Jim Battin RLa Quinta to 
slash the rates paid to alternative energy producersa move expected to 
shave  billion or more in annual costs charged to the big private 
utilities Reducing the amount paid to producers of renewable energy such as 
solar wind and biomass power is considered a crucial step in keeping 
expected consumer rate hikes down
And after  days of dangerously low electricity supplies the state 
got a reprieve Thursday morning when grid officials lifted the states 
electrical emergency status for the first time since Jan 
So far the state has spent nearly  billion buying electricity on 
behalf of the utilities according to the Department of Finance which 
informed the Legislature on Thursday that it will release another  
million for electricity purchases

Energy Firms Wont Pay All of Monster Debt
PUC reverses taxpayers could foot the bill 
Christian Berthelsen Chronicle Staff Writer
FridayFebruary   

 Under a ruling yesterday by state regulators California taxpayers could be 
on the hook for hundreds of   millions of dollars in power purchases the 
state has made in behalf of two troubled utilities 
The California Public Utilities Commission voted unanimously to absolve 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison of responsibility 
for any costs above the revenue they collect from ratepayers 
The ruling reversed a position taken earlier by the commission which had 
said the utilities were responsible for making up the difference between the 
states costs and their own revenue 
John Tremaine a PGE spokesman said the funding needed to make up the 
difference could come in the form of a surcharge imposed on customers who use 
 percent of the baseline amount of electricity That is one option under a 
bill passed last month by the Legislature he said 
But Steve Maviglio a spokesman for Gov Gray Davis said the governor does 
not believe the money will come from ratepayers electric bills The costs 
Maviglio said could be covered by the  billion bond measure the state 
recently issued to cover power purchases 
As California tries to resolve its power crisis state officials are working 
out the precise way that should be done 
Under the states deregulation plan approved in  the utilities have been 
forced to absorb skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs while being 
prevented by law from passing the increases on to customers through higher 
rates 
Since the California Department of Water Resources began buying power last 
month details showing how it will be repaid how much or by whom have not 
been established 
Yesterdays PUC decision was an attempt to begin setting the repayment 
criteria 
A precise accounting of how much money is at stake is impossible to determine 
at this point officials said because PGE declines to release ratepayer 
revenue figures and the state is refusing to say exactly how much it has 
spent buying power Officials estimate the state will spend  billion by 
the beginning of March and Davis authorized the expenditure of  million 
more yesterday 
The states Department of Water Resources became the buyer of record on Jan 
 when the two utilities credit was so damaged that they were no longer 
able to buy power 
Both utilities had opposed the commissions previous position that they be 
responsible for all power costs 
The PUCs shift yesterday was summed up by Commissioner Richard Bilas who 
said he could not support holding the utilities responsible for the revenue 
shortfall The DWR is not about to go bankrupt the utilities are he said 
Yet consumer advocates downplayed the commissions ruling yesterday Nettie 
Hoge executive director of The Utility Reform Network said the ruling only 
dealt with the narrow issue of who has to account for the revenue shortfall 
and did not reach an overarching decision about who ultimately will be 
financially responsible for it 
This is not a huge deal she said 
The state has been buying the lions share of its power in the realtime 
market run by the Independent System Operator since the demise of the longer 
term California Power Exchange said Jesus Arredondo a spokesman for the 
exchange 
The state has been paying premium prices because it is buying in a market 
that was designed to handle lastminute emergencies 
The governors office has been seeking cheaper longterm power contracts 
with only modest results 


Small electric producers OK big price cut

By Ed Mendel 
STAFF WRITER 
February   

SACRAMENTO  Legislators said yesterday that small generators who produce 
about  percent of the states power have agreed to cut their power prices 
in half an important step toward easing the electricity crisis 
Negotiations continued on what Gov Gray Davis has called the final step the 
state purchase of the transmission systems of the three investorowned 
utilities in exchange for paying off their huge debt 
Meanwhile the amount that the state is spending to buy power for the 
customers of the utilities grows Officials gave notice that an additional 
 million will be needed in  days bringing the total to  billion 
But for the first time in nearly six weeks the state did not declare an alert 
yesterday due to power shortages More power was available from other states 
and some power plants that had been shut down for maintenance resumed 
operation 
Two legislators Sen Jim Battin RPalm Desert and Assemblyman Fred Keeley 
DBoulder Creek said they introduced legislation that sharply reduces the 
prices paid to small generators after weeks of difficult negotiations 
Ultimately this bill will reduce the cost of energy to the state and its 
ratepayers by billions of dollars said Battin who represents eastern San 
Diego County 
About half of the small generators use renewable technologies such as 
solar wind geothermal and biomass The rest is cogeneration when fuel 
is used for industrial purposes and electricity is generated as a byproduct 
The small generators have grown to produce nearly a third of Californias 
power under a twodecadeold federal qualifying facilities program which 
requires utilities to buy their power 
Battin and Keeley said that under the bill SB X the average price for 
these QF contracts could drop from the current  cents per kilowatthour to 
about  to  cents per kilowatthour 
We believe that the rates are at least that low if not lower said Jan 
SmutnyJones executive director of the Independent Energy Producers which 
represents small and large generators 
The small generators support the bill because it will give them a stable 
price for five years avoiding ups and downs and the possibility that state 
regulators might make a more unfavorable price cut 
Much of the current price formula is based on the price of natural gas at the 
California border which has soared this winter The legislation spreads the 
price bench mark over a fiveyear period 
We encourage the Legislature to take quick action to approve SB X as 
quickly as possible to help stabilize the electricity crisis SmutnyJones 
said 
He said one of the side agreements to the legislation is the creation of a 
portfolio of longterm contracts to purchase natural gas for some 
cogenerators lowering their production costs 
The legislation was applauded as a major step forward by a group of small 
generators who formed a creditors committee last week and threatened to take 
the utilities into bankruptcy 
We call on the Legislature and the governor to act on it immediately said 
Chris Thompson a spokesman for the group 
Thompson said Southern California Edison continues to collect money from 
ratepayers as the state buys power for its customers but is not paying 
anything to the small nonpolluting generators 
A spokesman for a geothermal generator in El Centro which filed a lawsuit 
seeking  million from Edison for power provided since November welcomed 
the legislation for giving generators stability and ratepayers cheaper power 
But Vince Signorotti a spokesman for CalEnergy said it would be premature 
to consider dropping the lawsuit 
Battin and Keeley said that payment of the small generators depends on the 
governors attempt to negotiate the purchase of the transmission systems of 
Edison Pacific Gas and Electric and San Diego Gas and Electric in exchange 
for payment of their debt 
As part of the governors plan the utilities would agree to provide lowcost 
power for five to  years from their generators which provide about a third 
of the states power 
Davis aides are attempting to negotiate longterm contracts with generators 
for the remaining third of the power required by the state sharply reducing 
the cost of buying power on the expensive spot market 
But the governor said this week that many generators are reluctant to sign 
longterm contracts until they know how the utilities will pay their debt for 
previous power purchases 
The state called off all power alerts yesterday for the first time since 
midJanuary rescinding a Stage  alert declared Wednesday Grid operators 
made the change after increased power supplies became available 
The supply situation this week has gradually been improving said Lorie 
ODonley a spokeswoman with the California Independent System Operator 
which manages most of the states power supplies 
However she said the improvements shouldnt deter consumers from 
conservation 
It is good news to be out of electrical emergencies but we just want to 
remind everybody that we are looking at a longterm power supply situation 
here she said And the highdemand summer is just around the corner So we 
would ask that people continue with their conservation efforts 
In San Francisco yesterday state power regulators decided unanimously that 
the Department of Water Resources is responsible for buying any power that 
cashstrapped utilities are unable to generate or buy on their own  no 
matter what price wholesalers are charging 
But the PUC voted  against taking action that would have allowed the DWR 
to receive a portion of ratepayer revenues from the utilities to help cover 
the cost of buying electricity 
The state through the DWR was authorized by a recent law to buy power for 
the utilities Edison and PGE have such low credit ratings that no power 
companies will sell to them SDGEs rating is much better but its debt also 
was mounting 
The DWR purchases that portion of electricity beyond what the utilities 
provide through their own generating plants and through existing longterm 
contracts But the DWR has refused to buy power beyond a certain price That 
means more lastminute power purchases on the expensive spot market 
The utilities and the state had disagreed over how the DWR will be reimbursed 
 whether through state bonds or ratepayer dollars  and the extent of its 
powerbuying role 
The author of the bill authorizing the longterm contracts Assemblyman 
Keeley said the legislations intent was to fully cover the onethird of the 
power that utilities purchased on the spot market either through extended 
contracts or through the state ISO

Hi guys  

I wanted to let you know that I am extremely concerned about the 
Associate Analyst program so much so that I feel all the work I have done 
and all the time I have spent on the program has had little impact outside 
Wharton Penn recruiting  In fact we wont get more than  associate from 
Wharton this year for a variety of internal and external reasons  This 
program has brought incredible talent into the organization but we have lost 
a lot of momentum over the last two years

In as much as I would like to continue to support the program I cant  in 
its current form and dont have time to fix what I thought we had been 
addressing  The entire program is disfunctional and the commercial teams 
are not lending support to the program  Id be very happy to spend a few 
minutes of your time rather than blather on in an email to give you both my 
overview of the program and suggest changes and improvements  

You know you have my support but the current state of affairs down there has 
gotten me to my ropes end with the program

Most of West in the Same Power Jam as California
 Utilities Other states ran their grids at fever pitches as populations 
swelled and few new energy sources were developed Now also facing 
blackouts they want to tilt balance of power away from the Golden State and 
toward themselves


By PETER G GOSSELIN Times Staff Writer


     WINTERSBURG ArizFor more than a century California ran a simple 
account with the rest of the West It demanded and the West supplied most 
especially water and power
     But as the Western states have ballooned in the last decadein no small 
part because of an outbound trek of Californiansthis simple supplydemand 
relationship has broken down
     Fundamentally the rest of the West has outgrown its electrical system 
just as California has its own And it has done so in very much the same 
wayby adding too many people without enough new power or conservation
     Indeed statistics show that much of the rest of the West would have 
been on the verge of trouble even without Californias help and may yet face 
the sort of rolling blackouts that have wreaked so much havoc in the Golden 
State
     The booming Southwest has run its power grid at such a fever pitch that 
its planning reservesthe extra power that utilities build in to handle 
emergencieshave shrunk to levels that many regulators and industry experts 
consider dangerous
     Almost none of the West save Montana has increased its power production 
at anything like the pace of its population growth during the last decade 
Despite the long economic boom of the s which smiled especially on the 
West several such as Arizona have failed to complete a single new power 
plant
     We dont know how bad its going to be yet said Utahs Republican 
governor Mike Leavitt We wont know that until May June July and August 
when everyone in the Southwest turns on their swamp coolers
     In trying to dodge the blackout bullet many Western leaders are seeking 
to force a great change on the region to renegotiate their states basic 
deal with California They want to end an old relationshipthat between 
center and hinterland colonizer and colonizedand establish a new one that 
could curtail Californias long regional dominance
     In the strange chemistry of the momentwhen a onceRepublican state 
government has turned Democratic and a onceDemocratic national government 
has turned Republican when the battle is to a large extent over privately 
owned electricity rather than publicly controlled waterthey could actually 
meet with some success
     California spent the th century decolonizing itself from Wall Street 
and the East said Kevin Starr the state librarian and author of a 
multivolume history of California Now all of a sudden theres a dramatic 
possibility of it being recolonized at least in part by the rest of the 
West

     Captive Plants Feed Power to California
     Ground zero for these changes lies  miles west of Phoenix in the dry 
scrublands of Wintersburg This is home to the Palo Verde nuclear facility 
now the nations single biggest power producer It will soon be home as well 
to between three and six new gasfired power plants that combined will 
produce even more electricity than their giant neighbor
     Palo Verde represents a great deal about the old fraying world of 
regulated utilities and about the supplydemand relationships that California 
once maintained with the rest of the West
     More than onequarter of the plant is owned by Los Angeles municipal 
utility the Department of Water and Power several other California cities 
and Southern California Edison
     A row of steel latticework towers runs off toward California carrying a 
transmission line from plant to consumer California has big stakes in a 
halfdozen similarly captive plants in an arc of states from Nevada to New 
Mexico
     From Californias point of view the beauty of these projects has been 
that they provided nearcertain power without the muss of meeting state 
pollution standards or the political hassle of building closer to home
     And at least until the mids California regulators virtually 
guaranteed that their owners covered their costs and made profits even if 
plants power wasnt immediately needed
     The first principle of the old system was that you had to be able to 
meet demand no matter what said Paul L Joskow a veteran utility 
economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
     If you had too much power if it cost you a little too much that was 
less important than being sure you could meet demand And he added you 
had regulators watching to make sure you did
     The gasfired plants that are about to pop up in Wintersburg are also 
representative but of the new deregulated world of power production 
Although they will crowd in around Palo Verde and tap into the same 
California transmission line they are being built on an entirely different 
business premise selling power to the highest bidder
     In fact the reason this empty patch of desert has become such an 
electricity hot spot lately is not Palo Verde itself but its huge 
transmission lines In addition to the California line four others fan out 
from the plant two back to Phoenix one east to New Mexico and one north to 
Utah and from there to the Northwest
     All were built to hardwire the nuclear project to its owners But they 
are now seen as the means by which a new breed of producer can get top dollar 
by sending power wherever prices are highest
     It used to be generating capacity was built by people who looked at the 
market to see if they could meet demand said Jack Davis president of 
Pinnacle West Capital Corp which owns Arizonas major utility and is 
putting up two of the Wintersburg plants
     Now he said approvingly its being built by people who look at the 
market to see if you can make a lot of money

     Plans Go Awry in Many States
     Money not the watchful eye of government was what was supposed to 
assure that electricity deregulation worked The opportunity to make it would 
cause investors to flock to the electricity business ensuring that plenty of 
new power plants got built
     If too many went up it would be investors not ratepayers who 
suffered If too few then high prices would attract still more investors 
more plants and ultimately more power
     But to date almost nothing about deregulation has gone as plannedand 
not just in California but in the West in general
     Take Arizona The state has a handsoff attitude toward business 
including its utilities It has almost none of the environmental restrictions 
blamed for keeping California from putting up the new plants it needs
     Its population grew by  from  to  according to the Census 
Bureau And its demand for electricity expanded at nearly twice that rate 
according to industry figures
     Arizona should have been a power producers heaven said A Michael 
Schaal a senior analyst with Energy Ventures Analysis Inc a prominent 
Washingtonarea consulting firm
     But Arizonas power production rose a mere  during the s mostly 
as a result of improving existing plants Until  months ago no one had 
applied to build a major power plant since Palo Verde in the late s
     I guess I go on the assumption that the utilities plan with some sort 
of   year time horizon Arizonas Republican Gov Jane Dee Hull 
said in a recent interview I think what we all worry about is Are they 
planning
     Or Nevada Its utilities apparently did plan and increased 
electricitymaking capacity between  and  by a substantial  But 
that wasnt enough to keep up with the states population which increased 
 On Thursday Nevada Gov Kenny Guinn a Republican and former energy 
company executive indefinitely halted deregulation in his state
     Or traditionally energyrich Washington state One of its major 
utilities Seattle City Light recently learned that all of its previously 
planned supply increase for the next four years will be consumed and then 
some by just three new customers computer server farms being built to 
handle the growing Internet traffic in and out of the hightech capital
     But its unlikely to be able to get extra power soon because regional 
supplies are balanced on a razors edge according to Northwest Power Pool 
President Jerry Rust We have no cushion
     Indeed the electricity supplies of the entire West are balanced on a 
razors edge with a variety of forecasters predicting serious shortages this 
summer
     Schaal the Washingtonarea consultant for example said the region 
will come up  short Westerners can expect  to  hours of rolling 
blackouts most of them in California he said
     One of the most striking aspects of the current situation is that in 
contrast to what most people think supplies have not grown short just 
recently
     They have been perilously tight for the last several yearsbefore the 
start of Californias troubles of this summer and fall and before the 
nearrecord dry winter that has left the Northwest dangerously short of water 
for its hydroelectric dams
     The implication is that California did not cause other states to run 
short of power so much as trigger events that exposed their danger It did 
that according to key observers with one monumentally inept maneuver
     When California required its major utilities to buy power in the 
volatile spot market and simultaneously prohibited them from passing along 
higher costs to consumers it set off a furious price spiral
     That effectively stripped the entire region of its energy security 
blanket the assurance that it could buy extra power relatively inexpensively 
if local supplies proved inadequate
     The result has been a string of crises across the West
     In southern Arizona for example the San Carlos Irrigation Project a 
tiny public utility that tried to jump into the deregulation vanguard by 
dropping longterm contracts in hopes of more power at lower prices in the 
spot market has announced that its bills are going up  Most of the 
projects  poor customers say they cant pay
     In Phoenix utility executives who had confidently said the state was 
rich with new power projects about to come on line have decided to pull two 
yearold steam plants out of mothballs and rent a pair of portable 
generators to reduce purchases from the expensive spot market
     In Idaho the big power company is appealing to potato farmers to skip 
planting and sell the electricity they would use running irrigation pumps 
back to the firm Company executives figure the buyback will be cheaper than 
purchasing power on the open marketand the potato farmers are likely to do 
pretty well themselves

     Deep Hostility in Rest of the West
     The subtle difference between Californias triggering recent events and 
actually causing the regions crisis is largely lost in the current 
atmosphere of apprehension and upheaval Although leaders of the rest of the 
West are scrupulously evenhanded in commenting to outsiders about their big 
neighbor they are less guarded at home
     The normally mildmannered Leavitt for example was recently quoted as 
warning a Salt Lake City audience that California if given the chance 
would put a shunt into our veins and bleed us pretty quickly In an 
interview he denied having made the remark
     Such comments reflect an old and easily rekindled view among Westerners 
that their states are in the words of historian Bernard DeVoto plundered 
provincesterrain that first Easterners and then Californians have 
regularly raided for minerals water and most recently power
     But this time some Western leaders think they can change all this A 
lot of people see an opportunity to rewrite the fundamental relationship with 
California to their advantage said Stanford historian Richard White
     The attempts at rewriting are taking shape across the West
     In the Northwest Oregon Washington Idaho and Montana are redoubling 
their efforts to take over the Bonneville Power Administration the huge 
federally controlled generating system on the Columbia and Snake rivers that 
is one of Californias chief sources of summer electricity 
     The crisis has highlighted the danger that power generated in the 
region can be exported without the regions consent Oregon Gov John 
Kitzhaber said in an interview
     In Arizona state officials have gone from having no proposals for new 
power plants to being buried by them Regulators recently approved the 
construction of  plants including several around Palo Verde and are 
considering another eight
     Although they are requiring the plants to temporarily serve Arizonas 
needs first the facilities will soon be able to sell their power for 
whatever prices they can command an arrangement that could leave California 
just one among many bidders
     Federal officials are unlikely to get in the way Gov Hull is close to 
President Bush who in turn has shown little interest in helping Democratic 
California
     Perhaps the most aggressive efforts at change are occurring in Utah 
where Leavitt is trying something that could become Californias worst 
nightmarerecalling power that Utah produces for the state
     Los Angeles DWP and several other California utilities own 
threequarters of the huge coalfired Intermountain Power Project in 
westcentral Utah and have been drawing on it without incident for  years
     But Utah officials recently unearthed a longforgotten provision in 
their agreement with the plants owners that gives them the right with 
proper notice to recall power for local use
     The state has already notified Los Angeles that it is taking back  
megawatts of electricity capacity this summer and another  next summer 
and it may be able to take back still more according to plant general 
manager Reed Searle
     Although the amounts are trivialthe Los Angeles utility either owns or 
has firm contracts for more than  megawatts of capacityLeavitt said 
Utah will demand similar recall provisions in agreements for any new plants 
in the state including a  to megawatt facility that Los Angeles is 
negotiating to build
     California has chosen not to create its own power generation and has 
depended on us to do that the Utah governor said Thats fine and were 
willing to do that
     But he added there comes a point at which if demand grows too 
large weve got to hold some of this capacity back for ourselves and for 
our children and grandchildren
     If Utah and the rest of the West have reached that point California 
could be in for a much bigger and more enduring shock than the one from which 
it now suffers

		 Subject US Visit for GoodCorporation

Dear Steven

I know Michael Zilkha has written to you already but I wanted to thank you
too for the time you spent with us last Friday and the very valuable
insights you gave us I hope that I have given you most of the information
you need to understand our concept and to be able to discuss it with your
colleagues We agreed that on my return to the UK I would set out how Enron
might be involved at this stage and be one of the first US firms to pioneer
the idea and become a GoodCorporation network member able to display the
GoodCorporation trademark and start conversing with other members Those
members could be private companies public sector entities or government
departments trade associations NGOs etc

As we discussed the GoodCorporation Charter and processes are near
completion  We are in the process of starting our pilot verifications which
will be done by PwC KPMG Ernst  Young Intertek SGS and Bureau
VeritasWe are also setting up an Accreditation Body  which is being
modelled on the Forestry Stewardship Council  to oversee the annual
verification process 

The pilot programme provides companies with an excellent opportunity to have
a low risk way of trying out the process and seeing if it works in their
organisation They can submit the whole or a small part of the organisation
Pilot companies pay for the verifiers time only and the verifiers are
giving their time at cost   day The pilot itself will take the form
of a preliminary scoping meeting in which the verifier will take the company
through the evidence policies and procedures that need to be in place in
order to pass the GoodCorporation charter The meeting will decide who needs
to be interviewed in which locations and therefore the number of days
involved As the emphasis is on verifying policies and the way they are
implemented in the workplace rather than a full scale audit of impact the
number of days involved should be relatively limited  During the actual
verification the verifier will check for the evidence by reviewing
documentation provided by the company in addition to a series of meetings
with the relevant people such as the HR Director Environmental Manager
Finance Directors and customerfacing staff Assuming it is successful the
piloted part of the company can then become a member of the network if they
so choose 

It would be great to have Enron involved in this early piloting Given your
current policies and ethics I wouild be surprised if the charter posed any
real problem for you  It could also be a useful supply chain tool for you
to encourage your suppliers not only to say they behave in the manner you
wish them to behave but also demonstrate this behaviour to you and the
outside world in a transparent fashion Please get back to me if you require
any further clarification and of course I and my colleagues would be
delighted to meet whoever else you need to get involved before a decision is
made

Again many thanks for your time and I was delighted that you were
enthusiastic about our concept

With very best regards

Subject Northeast Water Plant

February  

I note that the HAWC and the Northeast Water Plant is on the Infrastructure 
Committees agenda tomorrow at Houston City Council

I am concerned about the proposed Azurix project with the Houston Area 
Water Corporation and the City of Houston Two weeks ago I met with the 
Mayor and City Attorney on the Mayors political business and they told me 
of their concern about the future of Azurix  They wanted some assurance 
from Ken or Jeff that Azurix would be around as a part of Enron if it were 
awarded the Northeast Water Plant Project  I believe they had some 
communications with Azurix officials but they really wanted to hear from 
someone at Enron

I sent the word back to Enron through Joe that someone high up should 
contract the Mayor and the City Attorney to give them whatever assurance 
they could concerning their concerns I believe Joe discussed this with Steve

Last Wednesday night I saw the Mayor and asked him if his request through 
me had any results  Had he heard from Enron  He said no and that he 
needed to have some better feeling about the future of Azurix

I assume we are working hard to get this project but based on my 
conversation I would think we need to give some communication to the Mayor 
from someone high up in the Enron organization

George

ON THE GRID OR OFF THE GRID
Bigger Is Better
An interstate electricity highway could leverage economies of scale to keep 
the lights on Burton A Weisbrod Glen E Weisbrod
SundayFebruary   
 San Francisco Chronicle

http  wwwsfgatecom cgibin articlecgifile chronicle archive    S
CDTL 
WE COULD HAVE left it to the states When the Interstate Highway System was 
proposed nearly  years ago we could have said Leave it to each state to 
decide on its roads and to pay for them or leave it to private enterprise to 
build toll roads wherever it is profitable Fortunately we didnt 
Today vehicles can travel throughout the country on a system of integrated 
highcapacity roads that crisscross the nation There are many differences 
between the flow of cars or trucks and the flow of electricity But just as 
the Interstate Highway System ushered in a new era of easier movement of 
people and goods across the states allowing enormous economic and social 
gains so too do we now need to overcome the obstacles to the easy flow of 
power across state lines 
Many forces are at work contributing to Californias electricity crises and 
power shortages in other parts of the country also are quite possible The 
growth of population and industry in California has expanded demand for 
electricity Legislative constraints reflecting environmental protection and 
other concerns have discouraged construction of electricitygenerating 
plants 
Periodic shutdowns of generation plants for maintenance have caused short 
term power shortages And in an oddity of California law the prices that 
power producers can charge distributors are deregulated while the prices 
that those distributors can charge consumers are regulated and restricted 
But largely missing from the debate of what can be done to balance supply and 
demand is discussion of an effective national power grid that would permit 
substantial amounts of electricity to flow as highway traffic does from one 
state to another 
Interstate transmission connections do exist now but are limited in 
capacity They were primarily designed to meet temporary needs associated 
with local power emergencies not for sustained use If those interstate 
lines were upgraded to greater capacity then we could move toward actually 
creating a national power grid 
An effective national power grid could result in far more competition among 
producers of electric power across the nation and far more options to meet 
demand in any local area No state or region would need to depend simply on a 
small number of generating producers within its borders and the increased 
number of interstate competitors would bring greater assurance of supply and 
lower prices 
The underlying problem is basically one of incentives With the maze of 
state and federal regulations on the production distribution and pricing of 
electricity there is great risk and little incentive for private 
construction of costly transmission lines that cross multiple state borders 
Imagine a power plant in state A but near state B with that plant 
occasionally having excess production capacity There is no market for the 
power in state B but there is demand for it in state C which is adjacent to 
it In a smoothly functioning efficient power transmission system power 
would move from the generating plant in state A across the border for use in 
state B thereby permitting deals so that power produced in that area could 
be sent to state C Through such a dominolike process power available in 
one region effectively can help alleviate a shortage in another area  with 
only a series of relatively shortdistance transmissions 
Development of such an integrated electricity transmission network is what 
the federal government can and should foster It would strengthen the nation 
it would expand options for users it would increase competition among 
suppliers to the benefit of consumers it would overcome the multiplicity of 
state regulations that have the effect of restricting incentives for 
profitable interstate power transmission 
The Interstate Highway System did not solve all the problems of the nations 
escalating population of cars and it was not cheap But designed to 
maximize interconnections between metropolitan areas with ample systemwide 
capacity to spare it did transform the country binding the  contiguous 
states into an integrated whole 
The effect reduced costs and increased exports of California fruits and 
vegetables to the Midwest and reduced costs along with increased exports of 
Midwest manufactured products to the West 
Just as it does not make sense for every state to act like a separate 
country building roads just for its own residents or growing all of its own 
food supply it is equally inefficient for each state to independently 
develop its own power supply It is foolish to find electricity producers in 
one state claiming that they should not help out consumers in another 
state 
A nationwide system would take better advantage of differential electricity 
demand in various parts of the country seasonally and even in the course of 
a day 
To consumers and industrial users in California the effects of a national 
electricity transmission grid would be real and enduring but not 
spectacular It would however go far to achieving the quiet result that 
every consumer seeks  lower prices more reliable electric power supplies 
There is no single solution to Californias energy crisis but developing a 
national interstate electricity highway system would go far toward addressing 
it Local power distribution within a state would remain a matter of state 
control The federal governments role would be largely to provide financial 
incentives for constructing additional interstate transmission capacity and 
to establish standards for its design and utilization  just as is the case 
with the Interstate Highway System 
A survey of history and government professors conducted by the Brookings 
Institution last year identified the Interstate Highway System as one of the 
Top Seven governmental achievements of the last  years  along with 
rebuilding Europe after World War II and expanding the right to vote An 
interstate electricity highway system could well be among the top 
achievements of government in the next halfcentury 
MACRO POWER TRANSMISSION
WE HAVE AN ELECTRIC power crisis in California In fact we have two 
problems a shortterm problem and a longterm problem 
Short term the problem from the consumer perspective is 
 Soaring electricity bills 
 Fear of paying the mounting debts being incurred by electricity 
distributors such as Pacific Gas and Electric Co either in rate increases or 
higher taxes 
 The threat and to some users the reality of no lights no refrigeration 
no heat 
These concerns are real and severe But they are merely symptoms of a serious 
longterm crisis Incentives to the power industry are wrong 
As Adam Smith reminded us over two centuries ago we do not look to the good 
intentions of sellers to get them to serve the public interest we look to 
their self interest Then as today wise public policy calls for aligning 
the two by providing incentives for the development of an electricity system 
that provides power that is dependable is produced efficiently and is 
distributed competitively so that prices are low 
This longterm problem will not be solved by the series of BandAids that 
governmental officials and power producers and distributors are skirmishing 
over Now is the time to develop a longterm plan 
Two elements of a longterm plan for efficient and reliable electricity are 
clear 
 Electricity selfsufficiency for each state is bad policy It is easy to 
think that dependency on power imports from other states is a root problem 
It is not Trade and competition mean access to more producers and that can 
bring efficiency in electricity no less than in food electronics or autos 
as lowcost sources are utilized Promoting more interstate options does not 
preclude building more local generation and small micro electricity 
generating units do have a role as part of an overall electricity policy 
However the advantage of their flexibility must be balanced against their 
generally higher cost for meeting predictable longterm demand 
 Incentives are needed to encourage investment in electricity transmission 
It does no good to have lowcost power production unless the power can reach 
users This is why the federal government has such an important role to play 
in financially encouraging and supporting a national interstate power highway 
system

Signaling a greater urgency in Californias power crisis Gov Gray Davis 
said yesterday that keeping the lights and air conditioners running this 
summer will require every Californian to reduce electricity usage by about  
percent 
In addition he said the state must get more electrical power online by 
then 
His call for a  percent cut is a significant jump from the  percent he was 
asking for during his State of the State speech last month and it may be a 
difficult stretch for consumers Davis made his remarks on NBCs news show 
Meet the Press 
State Sen Don Perata DOakland praised the governors statement on 
national television 
The most important thing right now is that the governor said that because 
there has been general skepticism statewide reflected both in anecdotes and 
public opinion polls that we are in fact facing a crisis Perata said If 
you dont believe you wont conform you wont respond 
But he said Davis will not get the conservation he wants unless consumers 
are given financial incentives Perata said he will propose legislation today 
to give  billion to customers who cut down on their electricity use during 
the summer months 
Severin Borenstein director of the Energy Institute at the University of 
California at Berkeley said if temperatures soar this summer it will take a 
huge effort to keep the state at safe electricity levels 
NEED FOR CONSERVATION
We are in big trouble Borenstein said That doesnt mean we cant avoid 
blackouts  that means we will have to take serious measures 
The needed steps include instituting variable prices for commercial and 
industrial users that reflect the supply and demand at any given hour and 
hooking up air conditioners to cycling systems he said For residential 
users 
he said it will mean increases for use above a certain level 
Forecasters predict a shortfall of at least  megawatts this summer but 
the state got some good news Thursday when the California Independent System 
Operator which coordinates the flow of electricity through the states power 
grid removed all power alerts for the first time in more than a month 
Lorie ODonley a spokeswoman for the California ISO said that she does not 
expect any changes today but that it is too early to make any predictions 
about the summer power situation 
We still need to check the snowpack and the hills and the hydro situation in 
the state ODonley said Conservation is a big part of it and whatever 
people can do to step up their conservation efforts will be a huge factor in 
avoiding blackouts 
GOVERNOR DODGES BLAME
Davis appeared on Meet the Press while visiting Washington DC for a 
meeting of the National Governors Association and a concurrent meeting of the 
Democratic Governors Association which he chairs With him on the program 
were Sen John Kerry DMass Sen Pete Domenici RNM and Republican 
Gov Mike Huckabee of Arkansas 
Davis took the opportunity of the highprofile television show to tell East 
Coast decisionmakers and Wall Street analysts that the blame for the states 
energy crisis does not lie with him and to reassure them that he is taking 
solid steps to resolve the problem 
Both President Bush and I inherited California a flawed deregulation 
system he said during the broadcast Secondly no major plant has been 
built in California prior to my governorship for  years 
He outlined some solutions including the approval of nine new power plants 
with six under construction and three expected to be online this summer and 
 more in the pipeline 
In a slip of the tongue Davis said on yesterday mornings broadcast that 
consumers would need to cut electricity use to only  percent of last year 
It will require every Californian using about  percent of the electricity 
than they did the year before and a little luck in getting some extra 
megawatts on line this summer Davis said 
What he meant a spokesman said was they had to cut use by  percent 
Still that will require significant sacrifice 
In addition Davis has said that he wants to add  megawatts of power  
enough for  million homes  by summer He has promised to speed up the 
approval process and provide bonuses to builders who finish before July 
The state also established an  million conservation program this year 
But Borenstein said that many of the ideas floating around for spending the 
conservation money are for efforts that would not help for about another 
three years 
ON NATIONAL MATTERS
During yesterdays show Davis also weighed in on President Bushs taxcut 
proposal and former President Bill Clintons controversial lastminute 
pardons 
The administration should wait for a tax cut until the money is available he 
said 
All of us who have been in government for a while have seen the roller 
coaster ride of surpluses and then shortages and surpluses and shortages he 
said Clearly people need tax relief but it should be moderated to the 
point where we dont kill the golden goose which is a strong growing 
economy  
Although he received a significant campaign donation from the father of 
Carlos Vignali the Los Angeles drug kingpin Davis told show host Tim 
Russert that he never spoke with the family about the presidential pardon 
Vignali received on Clintons last day in office 
Davis said he did not have enough information to know whether the pardon was 
a mistake but he said theres something about them in general that 
doesnt ring right 
However he said people expect us to focus on things that matter to them 
and they really want to see progress on education the environment tax 
relief health care 
Asked by Russert whether he is going to run for president in  Davis did 
not rule it out but said that only reelection to the governorship in  is 
on his horizon 
Im focused on keeping the lights on and making our schools better he 
said

POWER POINTSCalif Gov Fiddles As Summer Likely To Burn 
By Mark Golden 


   
Dow Jones Energy Service 



Copyright c  Dow Jones  Company Inc 



A Dow Jones Newswires Column 
    

  NEW YORK Dow Jones Once there was a bride whose pianist became ill the
night before a beachfront wedding As she frantically tried to find a new
pianist the radio blared an alert A foot tidal wave was headed straight
for the beach
    



I just will not let this pianist ruin my wedding muttered the bride as she 
turned the radio off 
California Gov Gray Davis and the state Legislature have no better sense of 
priorities than the bride did Theyve been obsessing over the financial 
solvency of the states utilities for three months instead of making 
progress on the bigger problem the huge shortage of electricity expected to 
hit the state this summer Californias multibillion dollar purchase of the 
utilities transmission lines wont add one megawatt to the supply of 
electricity 
How big is the imbalance between supply and expected summer demand The 
California Energy Commission forecast two weeks ago that the megawatt 
system might just squeak by with  MW to spare in a bad heat wave But 
nobody takes that forecast seriously 
The CECs numbers are way off base Californias electricity demand could 
exceed supply by  or  MW on days with typical summer weather That 
 MW shortfall will be made up by turning out the lights in  million 
homes or a mix of homes businesses and industry A bad heat wave would get 
shortages several times that size As the blackouts roll through parts of the 
state every weekday that temperatures are at or above normal every business 
and home will take its turn at getting by without electricity for an hour or 
so What factory can operate under such conditions Will the states elderly 
survive the heat exposure 
The CEC put the capacity of generators in the state at about  but it 
used original capacity figures Most of Californias big power plants are 
more than  years old They cant produce as much power as they once did so 
subtract about  MW from their rated capacity 
About  MW of the states capacity is now controlled by merchant energy 
companies Calpine CPN Duke Energy DUK Dynegy DYN Mirant MIR 
Reliant Energy REI and Williams Cos WMB They say they already have sold 
much of the power they will generate this summer to outofstate western 
utilities But the CEC ignored that 
Hydroelectric generation in the western states is expected to be just  of 
normal this spring and summer Western utilities have been buying up supplies 
since last fall Californias PGE PCG and Edison International EIX 
couldnt do that of course because theyre nearly bankrupt 
Nobody knows exactly how much power has already been sold out of state A 
trader at one California merchant power company estimated  MW In a 
recent auction of transmission line use capacity to move electricity out of 
California sold for up to  times the price of transmission capacity to move 
power into the state 
The CEC ignored the sales of California power to outofstate generators in 
its rosy summer outlook and ignored the forecast for belownormal hydropower 
which depends on winter snowfall The snowfall season is threefourths over 
now making a hydropower shortage pretty much a done deal Yet the CEC used 
normal northwest hydropower production in its forecast Take off another 
 MW 
The commission expects  MW of generators to be off line for unplanned 
repairs when the heat wave hits Thats Californias historic average But 
outages usually increase dramatically during a heat wave Take off another 
 MW 
The commission expects all  MW of Davis recently announced peaking 
generators to be on line for the summer No way says the industry 
Instead of the CECs estimate of  MW then California can expect 
available supply of only  MW The state needs  MW to meet demand 
and maintain recommended reserves in the kind of heat wave it gets on 
average every two summers 
People in the industry have been telling the governor for nine months that 
theres no way to raise supply to meet demand this year or next Siting and 
building power plants takes too long Demand has to be reduced to the level 
of supply 
The current course is to reduce demand through blackouts Pricing offers a 
better way If the state raised electricity rates immediately  a step no 
longer opposed even by California consumer group The Utility Reform Network  
California would stop burning through the natural gas and water reserves 
needed to keep generators running this summer 
Davis insists on solving the crisis without a rate increase big enough to 
damp demand Several western US utilities outside California have already 
imposed such rate hikes Davis is focused on buying power even though 
California cant subsidize consumption of artificially cheap power much 
longer The Department of Water Resources is signing year power supply 
contracts at hefty prices that fully reflect todays supplydemand imbalance 
Instead he should be addressing the imbalance which must be dealt with 
sooner by prices or later by blackouts Raise California rates 
significantly now Cut demand and the wholesale price for electricity comes 
crashing down Then sign longterm contracts at the lower rates 
Davis is committing Californias citizens and businesses to  years of 
overpriced electricity After that he says he will try to reduce demand 
His streak of bad decisions in this crisis continues unbroken

Most of West in the Same Power Jam as California
Utilities Other states ran their grids at fever pitches as populations 
swelled and few new energy sources were developed Now also facing 
blackouts they want to tilt balance of power away from the Golden State and 
toward themselves
By PETER G GOSSELIN Times Staff Writer
WINTERSBURG ArizFor more than a century California ran a simple 
account with the rest of the West It demanded and the West supplied most 
especially water and power
But as the Western states have ballooned in the last decadein no small 
part because of an outbound trek of Californiansthis simple supplydemand 
relationship has broken down
Fundamentally the rest of the West has outgrown its electrical system 
just as California has its own And it has done so in very much the same 
wayby adding too many people without enough new power or conservation
Indeed statistics show that much of the rest of the West would have 
been on the verge of trouble even without Californias help and may yet face 
the sort of rolling blackouts that have wreaked so much havoc in the Golden 
State
The booming Southwest has run its power grid at such a fever pitch that 
its planning reservesthe extra power that utilities build in to handle 
emergencieshave shrunk to levels that many regulators and industry experts 
consider dangerous
Almost none of the West save Montana has increased its power production 
at anything like the pace of its population growth during the last decade 
Despite the long economic boom of the s which smiled especially on the 
West several such as Arizona have failed to complete a single new power 
plant
We dont know how bad its going to be yet said Utahs Republican 
governor Mike Leavitt We wont know that until May June July and August 
when everyone in the Southwest turns on their swamp coolers
In trying to dodge the blackout bullet many Western leaders are seeking 
to force a great change on the region to renegotiate their states basic 
deal with California They want to end an old relationshipthat between 
center and hinterland colonizer and colonizedand establish a new one that 
could curtail Californias long regional dominance
In the strange chemistry of the momentwhen a onceRepublican state 
government has turned Democratic and a onceDemocratic national government 
has turned Republican when the battle is to a large extent over privately 
owned electricity rather than publicly controlled waterthey could actually 
meet with some success
California spent the th century decolonizing itself from Wall Street 
and the East said Kevin Starr the state librarian and author of a 
multivolume history of California Now all of a sudden theres a dramatic 
possibility of it being recolonized at least in part by the rest of the 
West

Captive Plants Feed Power to California
Ground zero for these changes lies  miles west of Phoenix in the dry 
scrublands of Wintersburg This is home to the Palo Verde nuclear facility 
now the nations single biggest power producer It will soon be home as well 
to between three and six new gasfired power plants that combined will 
produce even more electricity than their giant neighbor
Palo Verde represents a great deal about the old fraying world of 
regulated utilities and about the supplydemand relationships that California 
once maintained with the rest of the West
More than onequarter of the plant is owned by Los Angeles municipal 
utility the Department of Water and Power several other California cities 
and Southern California Edison
A row of steel latticework towers runs off toward California carrying a 
transmission line from plant to consumer California has big stakes in a 
halfdozen similarly captive plants in an arc of states from Nevada to New 
Mexico
From Californias point of view the beauty of these projects has been 
that they provided nearcertain power without the muss of meeting state 
pollution standards or the political hassle of building closer to home
And at least until the mids California regulators virtually 
guaranteed that their owners covered their costs and made profits even if 
plants power wasnt immediately needed
The first principle of the old system was that you had to be able to 
meet demand no matter what said Paul L Joskow a veteran utility 
economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
If you had too much power if it cost you a little too much that was 
less important than being sure you could meet demand And he added you 
had regulators watching to make sure you did
The gasfired plants that are about to pop up in Wintersburg are also 
representative but of the new deregulated world of power production 
Although they will crowd in around Palo Verde and tap into the same 
California transmission line they are being built on an entirely different 
business premise selling power to the highest bidder
In fact the reason this empty patch of desert has become such an 
electricity hot spot lately is not Palo Verde itself but its huge 
transmission lines In addition to the California line four others fan out 
from the plant two back to Phoenix one east to New Mexico and one north to 
Utah and from there to the Northwest
All were built to hardwire the nuclear project to its owners But they 
are now seen as the means by which a new breed of producer can get top dollar 
by sending power wherever prices are highest
It used to be generating capacity was built by people who looked at the 
market to see if they could meet demand said Jack Davis president of 
Pinnacle West Capital Corp which owns Arizonas major utility and is 
putting up two of the Wintersburg plants
Now he said approvingly its being built by people who look at the 
market to see if you can make a lot of money

Plans Go Awry in Many States
Money not the watchful eye of government was what was supposed to 
assure that electricity deregulation worked The opportunity to make it would 
cause investors to flock to the electricity business ensuring that plenty of 
new power plants got built
If too many went up it would be investors not ratepayers who 
suffered If too few then high prices would attract still more investors 
more plants and ultimately more power
But to date almost nothing about deregulation has gone as plannedand 
not just in California but in the West in general
Take Arizona The state has a handsoff attitude toward business 
including its utilities It has almost none of the environmental restrictions 
blamed for keeping California from putting up the new plants it needs
Its population grew by  from  to  according to the Census 
Bureau And its demand for electricity expanded at nearly twice that rate 
according to industry figures
Arizona should have been a power producers heaven said A Michael 
Schaal a senior analyst with Energy Ventures Analysis Inc a prominent 
Washingtonarea consulting firm
But Arizonas power production rose a mere  during the s mostly 
as a result of improving existing plants Until  months ago no one had 
applied to build a major power plant since Palo Verde in the late s
I guess I go on the assumption that the utilities plan with some sort 
of   year time horizon Arizonas Republican Gov Jane Dee Hull 
said in a recent interview I think what we all worry about is Are they 
planning
Or Nevada Its utilities apparently did plan and increased 
electricitymaking capacity between  and  by a substantial  But 
that wasnt enough to keep up with the states population which increased 
 On Thursday Nevada Gov Kenny Guinn a Republican and former energy 
company executive indefinitely halted deregulation in his state
Or traditionally energyrich Washington state One of its major 
utilities Seattle City Light recently learned that all of its previously 
planned supply increase for the next four years will be consumed and then 
some by just three new customers computer server farms being built to 
handle the growing Internet traffic in and out of the hightech capital
But its unlikely to be able to get extra power soon because regional 
supplies are balanced on a razors edge according to Northwest Power Pool 
President Jerry Rust We have no cushion
Indeed the electricity supplies of the entire West are balanced on a 
razors edge with a variety of forecasters predicting serious shortages this 
summer
Schaal the Washingtonarea consultant for example said the region 
will come up  short Westerners can expect  to  hours of rolling 
blackouts most of them in California he said
One of the most striking aspects of the current situation is that in 
contrast to what most people think supplies have not grown short just 
recently
They have been perilously tight for the last several yearsbefore the 
start of Californias troubles of this summer and fall and before the 
nearrecord dry winter that has left the Northwest dangerously short of water 
for its hydroelectric dams
The implication is that California did not cause other states to run 
short of power so much as trigger events that exposed their danger It did 
that according to key observers with one monumentally inept maneuver
When California required its major utilities to buy power in the 
volatile spot market and simultaneously prohibited them from passing along 
higher costs to consumers it set off a furious price spiral
That effectively stripped the entire region of its energy security 
blanket the assurance that it could buy extra power relatively inexpensively 
if local supplies proved inadequate
The result has been a string of crises across the West
In southern Arizona for example the San Carlos Irrigation Project a 
tiny public utility that tried to jump into the deregulation vanguard by 
dropping longterm contracts in hopes of more power at lower prices in the 
spot market has announced that its bills are going up  Most of the 
projects  poor customers say they cant pay
In Phoenix utility executives who had confidently said the state was 
rich with new power projects about to come on line have decided to pull two 
yearold steam plants out of mothballs and rent a pair of portable 
generators to reduce purchases from the expensive spot market
In Idaho the big power company is appealing to potato farmers to skip 
planting and sell the electricity they would use running irrigation pumps 
back to the firm Company executives figure the buyback will be cheaper than 
purchasing power on the open marketand the potato farmers are likely to do 
pretty well themselves

Deep Hostility in Rest of the West
The subtle difference between Californias triggering recent events and 
actually causing the regions crisis is largely lost in the current 
atmosphere of apprehension and upheaval Although leaders of the rest of the 
West are scrupulously evenhanded in commenting to outsiders about their big 
neighbor they are less guarded at home
The normally mildmannered Leavitt for example was recently quoted as 
warning a Salt Lake City audience that California if given the chance 
would put a shunt into our veins and bleed us pretty quickly In an 
interview he denied having made the remark
Such comments reflect an old and easily rekindled view among Westerners 
that their states are in the words of historian Bernard DeVoto plundered 
provincesterrain that first Easterners and then Californians have 
regularly raided for minerals water and most recently power
But this time some Western leaders think they can change all this A 
lot of people see an opportunity to rewrite the fundamental relationship with 
California to their advantage said Stanford historian Richard White
The attempts at rewriting are taking shape across the West
In the Northwest Oregon Washington Idaho and Montana are redoubling 
their efforts to take over the Bonneville Power Administration the huge 
federally controlled generating system on the Columbia and Snake rivers that 
is one of Californias chief sources of summer electricity 
The crisis has highlighted the danger that power generated in the 
region can be exported without the regions consent Oregon Gov John 
Kitzhaber said in an interview
In Arizona state officials have gone from having no proposals for new 
power plants to being buried by them Regulators recently approved the 
construction of  plants including several around Palo Verde and are 
considering another eight
Although they are requiring the plants to temporarily serve Arizonas 
needs first the facilities will soon be able to sell their power for 
whatever prices they can command an arrangement that could leave California 
just one among many bidders
Federal officials are unlikely to get in the way Gov Hull is close to 
President Bush who in turn has shown little interest in helping Democratic 
California
Perhaps the most aggressive efforts at change are occurring in Utah 
where Leavitt is trying something that could become Californias worst 
nightmarerecalling power that Utah produces for the state
Los Angeles DWP and several other California utilities own 
threequarters of the huge coalfired Intermountain Power Project in 
westcentral Utah and have been drawing on it without incident for  years
But Utah officials recently unearthed a longforgotten provision in 
their agreement with the plants owners that gives them the right with 
proper notice to recall power for local use
The state has already notified Los Angeles that it is taking back  
megawatts of electricity capacity this summer and another  next summer 
and it may be able to take back still more according to plant general 
manager Reed Searle
Although the amounts are trivialthe Los Angeles utility either owns or 
has firm contracts for more than  megawatts of capacityLeavitt said 
Utah will demand similar recall provisions in agreements for any new plants 
in the state including a  to megawatt facility that Los Angeles is 
negotiating to build
California has chosen not to create its own power generation and has 
depended on us to do that the Utah governor said Thats fine and were 
willing to do that
But he added there comes a point at which if demand grows too 
large weve got to hold some of this capacity back for ourselves and for 
our children and grandchildren
If Utah and the rest of the West have reached that point California 
could be in for a much bigger and more enduring shock than the one from which 
it now suffers

Plant Construction Stalled Over States Effort to Revise Contracts 

Power Small peaker generators could help California get through the summer 
without blackouts 

By NANCY VOGEL Times Staff Writer 

SACRAMENTOThe construction of a fleet of small power plantscapable 
of supplying  million homesis being stalled because of a dispute between 
state officials and the plant builders
Two weeks ago Gov Gray Davis toured a power plant under construction 
among the orchards of Sutter County He ordered state Energy Commission 
regulators to roll out the red carpet for anybody willing to quickly build 
small sometimes temporary generators called peakers to help the state get 
through next summer without blackouts
Yet plans for  such plants which have been in the works since last 
fall have been slowed by the state according to the companies hired to 
build the plants The problem they say is that the California Department of 
Water Resources which was pushed into the electricity business on an 
emergency basis last month is trying to amend monthold contracts for 
construction of peaker plants
State officials say the original contracts gave too much to the plant 
builders and they want to save the taxpayers money by revising the terms
Were not delaying any construction said Davis spokesman Phil 
Trounstine Were providing financial assurances for the generators and 
protections for California consumers
Theres no reason he added that these guys cant rework these 
contracts and get these plants up and running on time
But peaker plant operators say the contract revisions probably will slow 
down construction 
Last week Harold Dittmer found out that the department wants to stretch 
to  years the terms of what had been a threeyear contract with his 
company Sacramentobased Wellhead Power
He said he is scrambling to alter land and equipment leases and isnt 
certain he will get his four power plants installed in the Central Valley by 
the target dates of May and July
Having to renegotiate the agreements adds uncertainty and uncertainty 
adds time Dittmer said
Some of the other eight companies with contracts to build peakers say 
theyve also been asked to alter their contracts
The projects will not be done in June as originally contemplated 
said Dale Fredericks chief executive officer of DG Power Inc in the San 
Francisco suburb of Walnut Creek His company intends to build seven small 
plants around the state with the combined capacity to supply more than 
 homes
These gasfired plants some so small they fit on the back of a bigrig 
truck are designed to run a few hours at times of heightened demand Most 
are slated for construction on existing industrial sites such as utility 
substations
Officials of the Department of Water Resources did not return calls for 
comment Steve Maviglio a spokesman for Davis said department officials are 
confident that the plants will all be finished this summer He said the 
agencythrust into the powerbuying business as a result of the 
nearbankruptcy of the states two biggest utilitieswants to amend the 
original contracts to save money
Were simply trying to get the best prices for taxpayers Maviglio 
said
But in slowing down the plant construction the departments action 
undermines the governors campaign to quickly expand the states power 
production Two weeks ago Davis ordered the Energy Commission to offer 
licensing of such plants in  days or less On Wednesday the commission 
published a list of  sites around the state that could by its estimation 
quickly and easily accommodate a peaker plant
Among these sites targeted for proximity to transmission lines and 
natural gas supplies are an airport in Kern County the port of Long Beach 
and a cardboard recycling plant in Ontario
Our target is  megawatts said Energy Commission spokeswoman 
Claudia Chandler
Fredericks the power plant builder said the states best shot of 
getting that much peaking power built by this summer is through existing 
contracts like his So many plants are under construction around the country 
that there is often a long wait for delivery of the turbines compressors and 
other crucial components of a power plant he said
Weve been working on this six months so we have equipment lined up 
said Fredericks who searched worldwide for the parts he needed But 
somebody coming in right now probably cant find the equipment
His company and eight others signed contracts last fall with the 
California Independent System Operator That nonprofit agency based east of 
Sacramento in Folsom was established under the states  deregulation 
plan to balance the flow of electricity on the transmission grid reaching  
of California
Typically CalISO wouldnt be in the business of soliciting 
construction of power plants But a scarcity of supply complicates CalISOs 
job Managers looking ahead to the summer of  predicted last year that 
the state would be short of electricity by onefifth of what it needs on 
those hottest afternoons when demand for power spikes upward
Warning of a very substantial risk of rotating blackouts in the summer 
of  CalISO officials signed contracts last October and November for  
small power plants to be built by June The plants would be capable of 
providing  megawatts of peaktime electricityenough to supply more 
than  million homesat a cost of  million a year for three years
That would amount to about  per California household per year CalISO 
staff figured
These costs wrote CalISO management in a memo to its policymaking 
board of governors should be weighed against the financial social and 
human costs associated with blackouts
We saw the summer of  coming like a freight train said Brian 
Theaker manager of reliability contracts at CalISO And we gulped and 
swallowed and said Weve got to do this because nobody else is 
Those contracts were signed despite the misgivings of two appointees of 
the governor
In an Oct  letter Public Utilities Commission Chairwoman Loretta 
Lynch and Michael Kahn head of the Electricity Oversight Board complained 
that the contracts for peaker plants seemed too expensive
They urged CalISO to refrain from signing the contracts until the PUC 
could check whether Edison and PGE were willing to build the plants more 
cheaply
But the utilities came forward with no such plans and the CalISO board 
approved the contracts
Under those contracts the plants would be required to produce 
electricity for  hours at most this summer when called upon to do so by 
CalISO
But work on the plants tapered off in January when the deteriorating 
financial condition of Edison and PGE threw the future of CalISO into 
jeopardy
CalISO doesnt actually buy electricity It bills utilities for the 
power it needs to balance the grid So as Edison and PGE spiraled toward 
bankruptcy in December CalISO lost its creditworthy status and 
companiesand their lendersfeared doing business with the agency
To calm those fears and to get construction underway the Department of 
Water Resources has offered to replace CalISO in the contracts But that has 
not yet happened as department officials seek to change the contracts The 
state has hired a Massachusetts firm Navigant to renegotiate the deals
If DWR would just assume the contracts as they are wed all be in high 
gear Dittmer said

Electricity Crisis Dims Firms Opinion of State 

Polling Four out of  small companies are less happy about Californias 
business climate and  are looking at a move 

By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS Times Staff Writer 

Four out of  small companies say Californias electricity crisis has 
dimmed their view of the state as a place to do business and nearly two in 
 are exploring a move to another state according to a survey released 
Friday by the National Federation of Independent Business
The survey one of the first to attempt to 
gauge the toll on business from the energy meltdown follows other polls 
issued this week that illuminate vastly different views of deregulation and 
the retail competition that it is intended to spark
Most California consumers said they still favor electricity competition 
in a survey conducted by JD Power  Associates More than half of the  
people interviewed said they did not understand deregulation but  said 
the state should continue to support competition in the electricity industry
But another survey by the BoozAllen  Hamilton consulting firm found 
that most commercial and industrial companies were wholly unprepared to 
take advantage of retail electricity competition around the nation and that 
few switched to new electricity providers While most of those that switched 
saved money on their electricity bills  paid the same or even more for 
power
If nothing else the three surveys underscore that problems in the 
electricity industry are confusing expensive frustrating and disruptive for 
all involved
This is a major issue the No  issue for small business said 
Martyn Hopper state director for the National Federation of Independent 
Business an advocacy group for small companies
Although California businesses have raised serious concerns about both 
energy costs and supply the states economy so far has shown only limited 
damage
Just more than  of respondents said they had been hit by blackouts 
since the beginning of the year the telephone survey of  small businesses 
conducted for NFIB by MasonDixon Polling  Research of Maryland found
But there clearly was some confusion among those answering the survey 
about whether these were the rotating blackouts that hit Northern and Central 
California on Jan  and  or whether these were voluntary power outages 
under utility programs that ask businesses to cut electricity usage when 
supplies are extremely tight For example  of respondents in the Los 
Angeles area said they had experienced a blackout when no forced outages 
occurred south of Bakersfield
For whatever reason the lights went out more than half of the 
businesses were forced to severely curtail or terminate business operations 
for the entire blackout
About onethird said they lost sales nearly  said materials were 
damaged or destroyed and nearly  had to absorb wage costs for work not 
done
Businesses were almost evenly split on whether the blackouts would lower 
earnings and nearly eight out of  were not planning any layoffs as a 
result
But the electricity mess has damaged the companies views of California 
as a secure business home Slightly more than  said the power problem had 
changed their views about California as a place to do business and nearly 
 said it had shaken their confidence in the states political and business 
leadership
But a whopping  said they have no intention of moving their companies 
to another state
Our members dont have the option of moving to Texas or Colorado in 
search of cheaper or more reliable power Hopper said A lot of them are 
family owned and minority owned    and they want to do business in 
California




NEWS ANALYSIS 
Once Accused of Inactivity Davis Now Takes Lead Role 

The governor has shifted into campaign mode in the power crisis trying to 
convince voters critics and investors that he can steer the state toward 
recovery 

By DAN MORAIN and RONE TEMPEST Times Staff Writers 

Just a month ago Gov Gray Davis was under fire for failing to move 
quickly and forcefully to quell Californias energy crisis
But in recent weeks the governor has moved into campaign modetouring 
power plants with TV cameras in tow and issuing a steady stream of 
proclamations that declare victories in the power battle
His mission is to convince voters in California analysts on Wall 
Street and politicos across the country that he is up to solving what he 
insists on calling the energy challenge
Davis is doing what any politician on the hustings would do Head out to 
a power plant under construction as he did recently put on a hard hat and 
tell gathered reporters that he is working to make sure the state will have 
enough power to meet its needs
Because it is so complicated and hydraheaded said Garry South 
Davis chief political consultant we really felt he had to move out and 
simplify and objectify what he is doing Otherwise people simply wouldnt 
see that he had a plan to solve the problem
This isnt rocket science South added The communication tools and 
techniques that any elected official has dont differ that much from what 
is available in a campaign
Davis arrived Friday night in Washington DC on the first leg of a 
fiveday East Coast trip that will take him to Wall Street In recent weeks 
he has compiled a story to tell of actions he has taken that suggest he is on 
top of the situation
Critics counter that his plans are half measures On Friday for 
example he did not announce a final deal to rescue the states three private 
utilities from their multibillion dollar debt Rather he proclaimed that he 
had the framework of an accord with one of the utilities Southern California 
Edison
However the goal is to show progress even if its incremental
The public just wants it solved said Democratic political consultant 
Darry Sragow who doesnt work for Davis He is working to show that he is 
working to solve the problem If there is a view that no one is solving his 
problem all hell will break loose
The actions are a far cry from the situation in January when utility 
executives power generators and lawmakers were loudly blaming Davis for 
failing to recognize the power crisis and for not taking steps soon enough to 
get California on course for recovery
Davis confidantes say there was no single event that led to the 
governors decision to position himself as the man who would lead California 
out of the crisis But the governor pays close attention to 
politicsconferring at least weekly with his team of political advisors and 
regularly scrutinizing public opinion polls
After convening two focus groups on the topic last month the governor 
and his political advisors led by South concluded that Davis needed to take 
a higher profile The prospect of the states two major utilities going broke 
also spurred the governor into action
It became important to let Wall Street creditors generators and the 
public understand that we were making progress said Davis communication 
director Phil Trounstine Thats a big piece of why youve seen the governor 
personally carrying the message
Davis still has critics including many in his party But few can say 
that he is still suffering from inaction He is pushing for a state 
takeoverat a cost of more than  billionof private utilities electrical 
transmission systems and spending money at a clip of  billion a month to 
buy electricity
Flush with a multibillion budget surplus the Davis administration has 
spent more than  billion to buy electricity so far It is offering an extra 
 million for conservation measures and pledges to spend millions more to 
speed construction of new power plants
Aides say practical reasons prevented Davis from taking a more public 
role sooner He was spending most of his time gaining an understanding of the 
problem and looking for solutions
Davis was freed up only after he assembled his energy team led by 
former Edison executive Michael Peevey San Francisco lawyer Michael Kahn 
and Department of Water and Power chief S David Freeman The trio gave Davis 
the expertise to negotiate with utility executives and power generators
Once they were in place Davis had time to make public appearances like 
the one in Yuba City earlier this month themed around generation and power 
plant constructionthe stuff of photo opportunities
It was a collective view that because this problem was so complicated 
and abstract he had to move out South said
And of course Davis political future is widely seen to ride on the 
outcome
Lawmakers give Davis credit for deflecting blame for the crisis from his 
office even if it means they pay the price But now that Davis has taken the 
lead role he faces risks if the plan fails
Im convinced if it blows up he is going to get the worst of it 
said one senior Democrat
Added Sragow Were not talking about anything that is particularly 
subtle or sophisticated The governor is chief executive the point person 
If the person who is the obvious choice doesnt lead there will be unrest 
and someone will try to fill the vacuum
Davis efforts are beginning to result in some praise A utility 
executive who a month ago was highly critical said after Davis announced the 
makings of a rescue plan for Edison that the governor forged a difficult and 
creative and complex agreement
I think you have to give him points for that the executive said

			California has appetite for electricity but is no power glutton

ANDREW BRIDGES Associated Press Writer

			Breaking News Sections 
			
			
			
			
			

			
			  PST LOS ANGELES AP  Californias power crisis has led 
neighboring states to accuse the Golden State of hogging electricity But the 
numbers tell a different story 
			California does use a vast amount of electricity But it consumes less on a 
percapita basis than all other states except Rhode Island 
			The mild climate and less heavy industry than other states are part of the 
reason Experts say credit also must go to stringent conservation measures 
			Its true were big and its true we didnt build a lot of power plants 
 But were not energy hogs at all said Arthur Rosenfeld who sits on 
the fivemember California Energy Commission Were almost as good as 
Western Europe and Western Europe is about twice as energyefficient as the 
United States 
			Among the  states only Texas consumes more energy  measured by its total 
use of electricity natural gas and oil  than California the nations most 
populous state 
			However California ranks th in percapita energy use  well below No  
Texas No  Washington and No  Oregon according to the Energy 
Information Administration which is part of the US Energy Department 
			When looking specifically at percapita electricity consumption California 
ranks th at  million BTUs the agency said Californians percapita 
electricity use is only  percent of the national average 
			For air conditioning alone a typical California household uses onethird the 
amount of electricity consumed by a household in Texas or Florida according 
to the US Energy Departments  Residential Energy Consumption Survey 
			California has a different climate so even if you do have warm summers 
theyre not humid so you dont have the big huge air conditioning load you 
see in Florida or Texas said Robert Latta the surveys manager at the 
Energy Information Administration 
			California also uses electricity as well as natural gas oil and coal more 
wisely than most states thanks to aggressive conservation efforts started 
during the oil shocks of the early s federal and state data indicate 
			Key to those efforts are stringent standards for new homes and commercial 
buildings that dictate such things as the types of windows and lighting and 
the amount of insulation 
			If it is not the leading state they are at least tied for it in 
efficiency standards said Ed Wisniewski deputy director of the Bostonbased 
Consortium for Energy Efficiency Historically they have been very 
progressive and many of the programs we advocate nationally were started in 
California 
			Californias percapita use also is lower because many energyintensive 
industries are located elsewhere Aluminum smelting and paper manufacturing 
for example are clustered in the Pacific Northwest 
			The industries that are located in California however are generally more 
efficient in their use of electricity than industries elsewhere according to 
 figures from the California Energy Commission which shapes state energy 
policy 
			Companies use just  kilowatthours of electricity to produce every 
dollars worth of goods and services in California while businesses in 
neighboring states use twice as much according to commission figures 
			The concept that California is a big wasteful state really isnt true 
said Latta of the Energy Information Administration 
			There is still room for improvement in California particularly when it comes 
to conservation California ranks just th among all states in spending by 
utilities on energyefficiency programs as part of their revenue 
			In  California utilities reduced spending on energyefficiency programs 
though the current crisis has prompted the major utilities to reverse that 
according to the American Council for an EnergyEfficient Economy 
			Gov Gray Davis recently released a  million conservation program 
designed to control growth in the states demand for electricity 
			Maintaining energy efficiency and keeping demand in check as the population 
grows will be among the toughest challenges in the years ahead 
			Energy use per capita is up  percent over the past two decades 
Californians used about  kilowatt hours per year in  compared with 
about  kilowatt hours last year according to scientists at Lawrence 
Berkeley National Laboratory 
			And many people are moving to inland areas where they find cheaper housing 
but also face more severe summer temperatures that require greater use of air 
conditioning

USA US West spot power lower as plants return to service
 
   
Reuters English News Service 
C Reuters Limited  
LOS ANGELES Feb  Reuters  Spot electricity prices in 
the US West for Tuesday delivery were lower weakened by the 
return to service of some key power plants and comparatively 
light loads across the region 
Dealers noted the list of plants returning to service 
included the  megawatt Unit  at the Navajo coalfired plant 
in Arizona the  MW Unit  at the Ormond Beach gasfired 
plant in southern California and the  MW Unit  at the Moss 
Landing gasfired plant in northern California  
Their return was offset by the start of a planned outage at 
the  MW Unit  at the Navajo plant and expectations that the 
 MW Unit  at the Moss Landing gasfired plant would be 
brought down shortly for a planned upgrade 
There was also talk that the  MW Boardman coalfired 
plant in Oregon had tripped off line over the weekend although 
market sources said they believed the unit was back up on 
Monday morning 
Loads were reduced by generally mild daytime temperatures 
across the region although cold nights boosted offpeak demand 
The California Independent System Operator ISO forecast 
loads on the  percent of the state grid it oversees would 
peak Tuesday at  MW down from an expected peak on Monday 
of  MW 
Natural gas prices were steady to slightly higher with a 
range of  per million British thermal units 
compared with an average on Friday of  
Gas fuels about a third of California s power plants 
Weather Services Corp forecast Northwest temperatures 
would be mostly  degrees F below normal through Tuesday

Calif Pwr Plan May Face Stumbling Blocks In Legislature

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
   
LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Key lawmakers in the California Assembly and Senate 
on Monday were only willing to offer partial support for a plan by Gov Gray 
Davis to buy the power lines owned by the states three investorowned 
utilities 
Their hesitance calls into question the chances of quick passage for the 
measure which is the centerpiece of the governors plan to keep the states 
two largest utilities from sliding into bankruptcy 
There are way too many unanswered questions about it both fundamental and 
logistical questions said the chief of staff to one key Democratic 
lawmaker 
On Friday Gov Davis announced at a news conference that he reached an 
agreement in principle with Edison International EIX unit Southern 
California Edison to purchase the utilitys transmission lines for  
billion roughly  times their book value 
Davis said he hopes to finalize the deal by Friday when he also hopes to 
announce similar deals for Sempra Energy SRE unit San Diego Gas  Electric 
and PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas  Electric  
Davis aides said the state is willing to pay about  billion for the 
 miles of transmission lines owned by the three utilities 
The buyout is aimed to restore the utilities to solvency and help them 
restructure nearly  billion in undercollected power costs the companies 
have amassed during  
But lawmakers said the measure wont sail through the Legislature State Sen 
Debra Bowen DRedondo Beach who chairs the Senate Energy Committee said 
she isnt willing to sign off on the transmission plan until the state 
secures concessions from generators and other creditors She also questioned 
the price the governor has offered for the power lines 
There are a number of advantages to having the state own and control the 
transmission lines but its not something we should do at any price Bowen 
said adding that the deal should also have value to ratepayers 
For the past several weeks key lawmakers Bowen Assembly Speaker Robert 
Hertzberg Assemblyman Fred Keely Senate leader John Burton and Assembly 
Republican Minority leader Bill Campbell the Democratic and Republican 
lawmakers who have stood with Davis during previous news conferences have 
been missing 
Advisers said the lawmakers have decided not to endorse Davis plan until 
more information has been released Sen Burton who introduced legislation 
three weeks ago to have the state purchase the utilities transmission lines 
also wouldnt declare his support for the governors plan 
As the governor noted this is an agreement in principle and the 
Legislature awaits further details said Burton press secretary Dave Sebeck 
Other Democrats refused to comment on the transmission plan while 
Republicans have been the most vocal opponents 
I dont see how we can pay for the transmission lines without a rate 
increase Campbell said If you refinance your house from a  
mortgage to a  mortgage youre going to have to pay more Thats a 
simple fact 
Consumer groups have blasted the governors proposal likening it to a 
bailout of the utilities 
Michael Shames executive director of the Utilities Consumer Action Network 
said the price the state is offering to pay for Southern California Edisons 
power lines is the outer limits of what can be financially justified as a 
purchase price for the transmission 
Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights said he 
will try and overturn the measure with an initiative on the  ballot 
But Davis isnt worried by his critics whether they be Democrat or 
Republican 
Responsible Democrats and Republicans will vote for this said Steve 
Maviglio press secretary to Davis

		 Subject Solve IOU Undercollection with a Mere  Average Rate Increase

Greetings

Please review the attached  Its a summary Ive put together of a very 
lengthy analysis MRW did for us over the weekend  Ive also attached the 
considerably lengthier MRW memo for those whod like to see it  The tables 
included in the summary are pulled directly from the MRW memo  The analysis 
only addresses the utilities undercollection ie solvency and doesnt 
address any additional increases that might result from DWRs buying 
activities

The Bottom Line
 By raising average rates  over a year period California could  
return the utilities to solvency and  help close the  supplydemand gap by 
providing customers with better price signals
 California could achieve these goals under this new rate structure and at 
the same time exclude onethird of residential  customers from any increases 
If California chose not to exclude any customers from the new rate structure 
California  would only need to raise average rates by about 
 This level of increase is in line with increases enacted in other states 
eg Washington  Montana  Idaho   Nevada 
 New Mexico 

Well need to look at it critically and try to shoot holes in it before going 
public with the numbers as part of our broader effort but it offers a 
reasonable benchmark against which to judge alternatives like spending the 
kids lunch money on crumbling broken down transmission systems

Please provide feedback as soon as possible and perhaps Paul we conclude 
the MRW work on the agenda for discussion on tomorrows daily conference call

Best
Jeff

Highlights
  On Friday   Governor Davis triumphantly announced that the State of 
   California and Edison International had reached an agreement in principle 
   for the sale of its electric transmission system as part of a financial 
   recovery package He also commented that good progress was made with 
   Sempra Energy and some progress with PGE Corp
  The preliminary terms of the agreement call for the State to buy Edisons 
   transmission system for approximately  billion x estimated book 
   value and allow for the securitization of a substantial portion of its 
   undercollection
  In exchange Edison would  make payments of approximately  million 
   to its utility subsidiary Southern California Edison  commit the 
entire 
   output of an Edison Mission project at costbased rates for  years  
   provide costbased rates from native generation for another  years  
   give conservation easements on  acreas of watershed lands for  
   years and  drop a pending lawsuit against the California Public 
   Utilities Commission
  We view this agreement as a positive development Based on the x 
   purchase price the EPS hit from the loss of the transmission lines would 
   be approximately  lower than our worst case estimate at x of 
     The agreement however is not final and additional details need 
to 
   be worked out before being submitted to the legislature
  Events to watch over the next couple of weeks include  a definitive 
   agreement with Edison  deals with PGE Corp and Sempra Energy  a 
   package that the legislature can accept which could include concessions 
   from generators and  terms that are acceptable by the FERC
  In our opinion the proposed deal is reasonable for EIX shareholders and 
   renews the hope for a resolution to the crisis While our optimism is 
   tempered by the shortening timeframe we are encouraged by the governors 
   recent statements which have been more positive than negative As such 
we 
   maintain our Buy ratings on Edison International and PGE Corp as well as 
   on the generation companies Calpine and Dynegy

Other News
In other related news on Friday   Edison announced that all of its banks
have agreed to extend their forbearance until March

  On February  EIX and Governor Davis reached an agreement in principal
   in which the state would agree to buy the transmission grid and allow
   for recovery of a substantial portion of unrecovered cost in return
   for EIX refunding money from its parent to the utility and dropping
   pending litigation  This settlement appears to be a  reasonable shared
   pain scenario and is consistent with the buyout vs bailout
   structure we have been anticipating To be enacted the deal needs to be
   finalized and approved by the EIX board and the California Legislature
   FERC also must approve the asset sale
  EIX agreed to sell a portion of its electric transmission system to the
   state of California for  billion and transfer  million cash to
   its utility subsidiary from the parent  In return the state would
   allow EIX to recover a substantial portion of its undercollected power
   costs and drop pending litigation in which the company is pursuing rate
   hikes  If approved by the EIX board and California legislature this
   agreement in concert with passage of ABX would eliminate the
   overhang that has depressed EIX shares
  Although dependent on several factors we believe the net impact on
   earnings from the settlement will not be as high as the current EIX
   stock price implies  We believe postsettlement EPS in  will likely
   total at least  share which supports a conservative valuation of
    share X  EPS a  valuation discount to the peer group
  Also late last week PCG issued a press release indicating they had met
   with the Governor had submitted proposals and discussions were
   ongoing  With the framework already established for EIX we expect a
   PCG settlement could be announced in the near future PCGs negotiating
   flexibility is limited relative to EIX because their generation rates
   are lower their underrecovered balance is higher and the potential
   cash refund from parent to subsidiary being requested by the
   government is probably larger
  PCGs transmission system has a book value of roughly  billion  At
   X book value these assets could potentially be worth  billion
   Assuming a parent company to utility cash transfer proportional to the
   one proposed for EIX we estimate PCG would refund  million PCGs
   stock price also reflects an earnings impact more punitive than implied
   by a settlement of this nature We believe a deal like this would
   support postsettlement EPS of at least  share which supports a
   conservative valuation of  share X  eps a  valuation
   discount to the peer group
  Because EIX has a deal in principle the stock is trading at a premium
   to PCG despite having lower potential  earnings power Those
   investors who believe PCG will strike a deal that is similar in
   structure and proportional to EIXs settlement should purchase PCG over
   EIX at this juncture

Investment Highlights
o    On Friday Governor Davis announced a preliminary agreement with Edison
International EIX D  on a financial resuscitation plan  The
plan follows the basic framework previously outlined by the Governor

o    The state will purchase Edisons transmission assets for B or x
book value  This would help pay off some of Edisons net B of
undercollections a number agreed upon with the Gov  The remainder will be
recovered through a bond financing tied to a dedicated rate component to be
carvedout of Edisons rates

o    In exchange Edison will agree to  Drop the lawsuit against the PUC 

Invest M back into the utility from the parent representing tax
overcollections  and  Sell power from its hydro and nuclear assets at cost
based rates for the next  years  Edison also agreed to sell power from its
unregulated Sunrise plant currently under construction at costbased rates
for  years

o    A number of uncertainties remain in Edisons deal and it is still
preliminary  The exact terms and language will be very important 
particularly
given the need to issue securitization bonds  It is impossible to provide
exact earnings guidance based on this deal but the only loss of earnings 
power
would appear to come from lost transmission earnings  share and
potentially lower generation earnings depending on the terms of costbased
rates

o    This is a significant step forward for Edison and the resolution of the 
CA
power credit crisis  However it could be for naught if the other utilities
cannot work out deals  We believe Sempra Energy SRE B  is
relatively close but PGEs PCG D  talks were flailing last
week  We continue to see little chance that this plan can move forward and
pass through the legislature unless all the utilities are on board

o    We believe PGE is willing to work a deal within this framework  
However
the simple problem is that PCGs undercollection numbers are much bigger  At
YE  PCGs net undercollection was more than B and we believe this may
have reached B by the end of January  Selling the transmission for x 
book
would provide only B leaving the other half to be recovered though the
dedicated rate component securitization  It may be that the only way the
numbers can work is with a rate increase

Despite the significant hurdles that remain we believe the momentum toward a
constructive outcome is improving  To that end we maintain our Accumulate
ratings on EIX and PCG for high rate accounts

		 Subject CA Supply Realities

Attached is a memo comparing the CECs forecasted supply and a more realistic 
look at what additional resources might be available this summer

The bottom line is that

  The CEC significantly underestimates the outages that may occur this 
summer  They estimate in their  MW supply deficit for the summer that 
expected outages will be around MW  However November and December saw 
significantly higher outage levels   MWs The FERC has investigated 
these outages and found no improprieties just that the plants are overtaxed 
from running at higher than normal capacities

  There are a lot of uncertainties surrounding the  MWs of projected 
supply from rerating restarting existing thermal and renewable projects  It 
is very unclear how much of this will be able to come on line by this summer 
if at all  As evidenced by the email I sent out this morning local 
communities may be very opposed to restarting shut down units  In addition 
these units are likely to be uneconomical

  In the existing resource pool there are roughly  MWs of peaking or 
other generation units that are running up against their operating hour 
limitations from air quality regulations  The Governor has ordered the local 
air quality districts to address these restrictions  We are beginning to 
seem some movement however the US EPA has yet to weigh in on these relaxed 
standards

  The distributed generation backup generation capacity to make up some of 
the shortfall is still an unknown  While there has been some relaxing of the 
limitations on run hours for backup generation at essential public 
services the increase in DG is expected from clean sources not diesel 
emergency generators

  The CEC is doing everything it can to get  MW peaking units online by 
this summer  They are promising a day permit application approval process 
and are offering to pay half of the cost of offsets for clean sources of 
generation in critical areas

Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information

Michael Tribolet held a conference call this evening to discuss Enron Winds 
legal obligations given SCEs nonpayment  In general given the legal 
structure of Enron Wind some action may be required from a partnership 
perspective

The key next step is action on SB  Interim ShortTerm Avoided Cost 
Methodology  Enron Wind is unlikely to take any action if real progress is 
made by this Friday  If not a different action plan will occur   This may 
change if other renewable QFs sue for instance FPL  who has retained

They will begin to draft some pleadings to prepare for legal action in case 
this is necessary  

Michael Tribolet is on point to hear if EWC takes any action and we should be

		 Subject CA Emissions Environmental Issues

Steve  We were hoping to provide a chart that plotted out the NOx emissions 
from existing fossil fuel generation vs new cleaner generation  This chart 
is not quite there  However it is a rough aggregate of the NOx generated by 
all of the existing fossil fuel generation over  MW in CA  The data points 
were gathered from the EPAs Acid Rain CEMs continuous emissions monitoring 
database  I am working on a chart thats message is more clear As you 
will see existing generation is significantly dirtier than what new 
combined cycle plants would be  In fact of the utility units in CA 
reporting under Title IV there are a number of steam plants with NOx 
emissions of  lb MMBtu or in some cases more  This corresponds to about  
lb NOx MWh compared to  lb MWh for a new gas combined cycle plant  Even 
the cleaner boilers that are at  lb MMBtu are  times higher than the 
new plants on an output basis  

In otherwords Dave Parquet is right that there is a lot of more polluting 
generation on line while new plants have to meet ever tighter BACT 
requirements



In the most recent version of SB  it looks like there are a lot of 
provisions focusing on the retrofitting of existing generation  I suspect 
the regulators are well aware of the discrepancies in emissions and would 
argue that the plants are going to have to clean up in the very near future  
I am digging for more information on these timelines

Gus Marc and I felt like the main short term fixes solutions would be

  Expanding the hours of operations for backup generators  As I have 
previously stated some of the local air districts have increased the 
permitted run hours for emergency generators from  to  at only 
essential public services  

  CA requiring offsetting of emissions at only the ratios required by 
Federal regulations  In many cases state requirements are more stringent

  The EPA allowing the concept of the pollution mitigation bank  it is 
really going to be an issue of timing  once the CA government has the funds 
to start acquiring offsets they will be able to provide them prior to the 
operation of a new generation facility However there is going to be some 
initial lag time where the offsets arent in the hands of the generation 
operators which goes against the requirements of the Clean Air Act

  The Feds working with the state and local permitters to create alternate 
sources of emission offsets  There simply arent enough in all the air 
districts  As I stated in my previous memo the USEPA has allowed under the 
NOx SIP call emissions allowances to be given to renewable and energy 
efficiency projects CA is going to need guidance from the USEPA in how to 
create and count alternate sources of offsets in nonattainment areas

  The USEPA better defining the nonattainment air sheds and pollution 
transportation pathways  Apparently there is not a central model of the air 
patterns in CA  Thus the  local air districts all having different 
requirements about interdistrict offsets

However the real issues as Dave alluded to in his memo are going to require 
modifications to the Clean Air Act  It is pretty prescriptive about what can 
and cant be done and there is not a whole lot of flexibility  

Let me know if anything in here is not clear  Im working on refining the 
data and presentation of the data

		 Subject Buy Down

We met with the legislator who is in charge of the Summer 
subcommittee today to discuss Enrons buy down proposal  Dave Freeman
had discussed the idea with her previously however his version
required that the contract be for a prearranged price based on the
notice you were given presumably by the ISO ie  hours  x  hours
 y etc  Consequently her concern with our proposal was the
uncertainty of allowing customers to choose whether or not they want to
shut down based on price versus requiring them to shut down to meet
demand ie a modified interruptable

She requested that we provide her with information about existing buy
down programs and their successes

"
2000-08-07T04:29:00-07:00,"As you have probably observed power markets have been severely tested this 
summer  There are many underlying causes demand growth driven by a strong 
economy failure of regulators to quickly grant applications for new 
generation inadequate access to the grid rate regulation which continues to 
insulate end users from real time price signals etc  But the soundbite 
on these troubles has been that deregulation has led to problems on the 
grid  The knee jerk policy response has been price caps and other threats of 
reregulation

At the upcoming advisory council meeting Ken and I were hoping that the two 
of you could discuss the issue and help put it in perspective

How great of a threat is reregulation
How might we respond
How likely is this issue to play a significant role in election politics"

Despite the fact the bill by itself does not guarantee payment for overdue

 irrespective of the progress on SBX   A press conference is planned for 
Friday by IEP  Bowen who heads up the first committee that this bill will 
go through will have hearings on this bill on Tuesday at the earliest

Jan SJ asked every QF to fax to IEP a description of all QF generation and 
the zip code of each project so that they can begin lobbying specific

SBX  is opposed by SCE  PGEs position appears more ambivalent  One 
angle would be to try to get PGE to support Enrons swap SC language and 
make inclusion of such language a condition of PGEs support

Governor Renews Criticism of Regulators 

Power The governor implies that the panel is too ideological Its approval 
is needed if California is to purchase the electricity transmission grid 

By DAN MORAIN and NANCY VOGEL Times Staff Writers 

WASHINGTONGov Gray Davis trying to win support for Californias plan 
to buy a huge stretch of the states electrical transmission system took a 
swipe Tuesday at the federal commission that must bless such a deal
Davis noted that President Bush has an opportunity to fill two vacancies 
on the fivemember Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and will determine 
its chairman
It is my hope Davis said that whoever the president chooses is a 
practical businessman or woman who lives in the real world and understands 
that when you inherit a mess your job is to fix it right the ship and move 
forwardas opposed to being a rigid adherent to ideology
Earlier this year Bush appointed Curt Hebert Jr a strong freemarket 
proponent who has served on the commission since  as chairman But he 
can change that appointment
Hebert a yearold attorney and former Mississippi lawmaker has said 
Davis plan to have California buy  miles of hightension power lines 
from the states ailing utilities would amount to nationalization and might 
not be in the public interest
The commission has been a strong advocate of electricity deregulation 
and in addition to the dispute over purchase of the power grid Davis has 
criticized its members for refusing to impose limits on soaring wholesale 
power prices which bled California utilities of billions of dollars in the 
last nine months
We have practical problems we have to solve he said citing the 
billions of dollars the utilities owe power generators and banks My hope is 
that Bush places people on the FERC who understand realworld 
considerations
Hebert could not be reached for comment Tuesday The commissions two 
other members William L Massey and Linda K Breathitt Democrats appointed 
by former President Bill Clinton were also unavailable There are two 
vacancies on the panel
Davis spoke after conferring for  minutes with US Energy Secretary 
Spencer Abraham about the states proposal to help the financially ailing 
utilities by purchasing the power grid He presented Abraham with a ninepage 
memo detailing the plan and said the energy secretary would probably give him 
his views on the plan by the end of the week
Last week the governor struck a tentative deal with Southern California 
Edison to buy its portion of the grid for  billion more than twice the 
book value He is working on similar deals with Pacific Gas  Electric and 
San Diego Gas  Electric Utilities could use money from the sale to 
restructure their multibilliondollar debt
Although Abraham has no direct authority over the energy commission he 
presumably holds influence with Bush and Davis came away from their 
conversation buoyed
If he would endorse the plan Davis said that would be a leg up in 
getting FERCs approval    I hope by the end of the week he will be able 
to endorse the proposal or at least endorse a modified proposal that is 
satisfactory to us
Believe me Davis said Ive been in enough meetings to know when 
someone is trying to be helpful and when someone is not Abraham is trying 
to be helpful He wants this problem solved and    I believe he will 
support our proposal to get Southern California Edison back into the energy 
business
Under federal law the energy commission would have to approve 
Californias purchase of the steel towers and aluminum wires of its three 
biggest private utilities The commission could scuttle the purchase if it 
determined that state ownership would harm the public interesta legal 
standard that gives the agency much discretion
Walter Ferguson Heberts chief of staff said Tuesday that Davis plan 
would get close scrutiny
Sure we have to be openminded but Im skeptical as to how this 
helps he said How does this solve the supply issue How does this impact 
the region Those two questions have got to be answered because you dont 
want to make the problem worse
Californias proposal runs counter to the commissions yearold push 
to have transmission grids operate on a wide regional scale without heed to 
political boundaries In some parts of the Midwest and South private 
companies have proposed operating transmission systems for profita trend 
endorsed by Hebert
I assume Hebert is going to be unenthusiastic probably very 
unenthusiastic about Californias proposal said Richard Pierce a George 
Washington University law professor who has observed the commission for 
decades
Nobody at FERC is going to be real happy about a state trying to take 
away from FERC jurisdiction over a large portion of a transmission grid he 
said I cant imagine any commissioner will like that So what were talking 
about is the intensity of their dislike and whether it will be so great 
theyll say No we wont approve it 
Consumer advocates and state Senate leader John Burton DSan Francisco 
have endorsed state purchase of the transmission grid as a way to get 
California out from under some federal oversight Ownership would for 
example allow the state to set the transmission fees that electricity 
consumers pay Those fees now amount to about  of the average utility 
customers monthly bill and are overseen by the energy commission
Burton has also argued that state ownership would give California 
greater control over its own destiny should federal officials try to force 
the West to manage its interconnected grid under a single agency
Federal rules already prohibit transmission grid owners from 
discriminating through fees or rules against the generators and marketers 
that use their lines like highways to move electricity from power plants to 
buyers
Davis in trying to win support for state purchase of the grid has not 
focused on the freedom from federal regulators California might gain 
Instead he has treated the idea as a key part of a financial transaction 
necessary to revitalize debtridden utilities
Davis said he expects that California would operate the transmission 
system within federal restrictions
I am not looking forward to any additional regulatory burdens from 
FERC Davis said Obviously we will meet the existing regulatory burden 
that we have
Whether the commission will approve a state purchase of the grid and how 
long it will take to reach a decision are unknown Edison International Chief 
Financial Officer Ted Craver told debt holders Tuesday in a conference call 
He characterized Heberts recent public statements on the matter as cryptic
A decision by FERC on sale of the grid could take many months 
according to research released Tuesday by Fitch Inc a creditrating firm
Fitch called the tentative agreement between Edison and the state a 
favorable step to avoid bankruptcy but noted that several hurdles remain 
chiefly approval by the state Legislature and the federal commission
State Sen Steve Peace DEl Cajon said that if the commission rejects 
Californias purchase of transmission lines the state should simply condemn 
the property
It was President Bush who told Gov Davis that California should solve 
this said Peace Gov Davis is doing so Certainly President Bush would 
expect the governor to use every tool at his disposal to solve it

Energy Crisis Fails to Hamper Selling of California Bonds 

By MIGUEL BUSTILLO Times Staff Writer 

The energy crisis is apparently not affecting Californias ability to 
finance its debt
California successfully sold  million in bonds Tuesday to provide 
funds for a variety of construction projects and already approved ballot 
measures including last years billion parks bond
Most of the sale  million represents new funding while the 
remainder will be used to refinance older bonds at current more favorable 
interest rates
The general obligation bonds overseen by state Treasurer Phil 
Angelides will have a  rate of interestwhich is actually lower than 
the last few general obligation bonds issued before the energy crisis
A day before the sale Wall Street creditrating firm Fitch IBCA blessed 
the bond issue with a favorable AA credit rating and reaffirmed its AA 
rating for the states  billion in outstanding bond debt The two other 
major rating agencies Standard  Poors and Moodys rated the bonds Aa and 
AA respectively
In releasing its rating Fitch analysts concluded that although the 
energy crisis is taking a substantial toll on Californias budget reserves 
that money will eventually be repaid through a billion bond issue that 
will be paid off by utility ratepayers
Moreover Fitch concluded the states percapita debt of  is 
moderate compared with that of other statesand the California economy has 
yet to show any signs of being significantly affected by the crisis
In anything thats tangibletax receipts employment informationwe 
have yet to see a real effect said Fitch vice chair Claire G Cohen

Energy Crisis Is a Benefit to Redding

High energy prices can create strange bedfellows 
Just ask Morpheus Lights Inc a powerhouse in the entertainment industry 
that has provided the lighting for the Academy Awards as well as the concerts 
of Bruce Springsteen Shania Twain Metallica and Ringo Starr and his All 
Star Band 
A fixture in Santa Clara County the company shifted its operations three 
years ago  miles north of San Francisco to Redding a city resting 
comfortably between the Cascades and the Trinity Alps that is known more for 
its Pendleton shirts and wily trout 
The move has paid off handsomely This city of about  has escaped the 
energy deregulation crisis that is roiling California and is in fact a 
seller of surplus power 
Thats good news to Morpheus which consumes some  kilowatts a month to 
test and manufacture huge performance lighting pieces like its BriteBurst 
which has enough power to light Com Park and was used in the  Super Bowl 
halftime festivities 
Morpheus is one of several success stories touted by the Economic Development 
Corporation of Shasta County which is attempting to sell businesses on an 
outdoorsy quality of life in Redding through which the Sacramento River 
meanders and where labor is plentiful and costs are low 
But theres much more the pitch goes Redding is a unique electrical island 
unto itself with its own electric utility and ample surplus power to sell  
this while investorowned utilities mull bankruptcy and the lights and the 
patience of business owners flicker in much of the rest of California  
Other states and regions of the country have initiated economic development 
campaigns to capitalize on California s misfortune seeking to lure 
businesses disgruntled by the energy crisis 
But as much or more aggressive efforts are now being developed within 
California to convince businesses they dont need to leave because there are 
sanctuaries of electrical stability 
NONPROFIT LOCAL UTILITY 
Redding has owned and operated its nonprofit electric utility since  The 
utility purchases significant amounts of its energy from the federally 
operated Central Valley Project through the Bonneville Power Administration 
in the Northwest and it generates energy at its own gasfired power plant 
In fact Redding Electric Utility REU has made so much money selling 
surplus power that it expects to pay off its debt a year from now two years 
earlier than originally expected 
We are a utility that has resources in excess of our needs and thats a nice 
place to be said Jim Feider director of the REU 
Several months before most Californians knew a longterm energy crisis 
loomed the Economic Development Corporation of Shasta County which seeks to 
attract business and the wealth it generates began to aggressively pursue 
small and midsize Bay Area manufacturing businesses looking to expand and 
relocate 
There is a lot of ground to make up in Shasta County said Jim Zauher the 
EDC president In   percent of the countys workforce was in 
manufacturing and most of that was in the timber industry which then 
tumbled 
Since then  jobs have been lost and manufacturing is at  percent 
That figure has been stabilized with  new jobs in the past four years 
The EDC has set a goal for the next five years of  jobs at  per hour 
In the Shasta Countyarea workforce of   in Shasta and another 
 in Tehama County a consultants survey has identified  
underemployed workers who have the skills education and experience that 
qualify them for a better job said Zauher 
Two weeks ago the Shasta County EDC retained a Silicon Valley insider Bill 
Haerle former vice president for government relations and national accounts 
at the American Electronics Association and former MCI executive as a 
consultant The EDC wants Haerle to create access to lowtech or midtech 
manufacturers 
First a company has to decide the threshold question whether it can 
operate in the greater Redding area Then they look at the cost of doing 
business and a large component of that is a reliable source of reasonable 
energy The third is the labor pool said Haerle 
STAYING IN STATE 
Shasta County offers a solution without leaving the state But this is a 
highly sensitive issue and we dont want to appear to be poaching he said 
We are looking for smaller companies that could flourish in the greater 
Redding area 
Haerle has yet to reel in a company but the path has been cleared by 
Morpheus Lights which moved up nearly three years ago and a handful of 
other small and midsize businesses in the past year 
In addition to energy savings Morpheus has seen other dividends The 
lighting company which was paying  a square foot for space in Santa 
Clara pays approximately  cents per square foot in Redding This enabled 
the company to move from a squarefoot space in Santa Clara to one 
with  square feet in Redding 
The extra space enables concert tour stage and lighting designers to conduct 
rehearsals with the computerized systems at the Redding site said Dan 
English Morpheus vice president of operations 
We can be anywhere as long as its close to a major freeway because the 
equipment travels by truck Theres I said English 
Nearby Knauf Fiber Glass of Shelbyville Ind a leading US manufacturer 
of thermal and acoustical fiberglass insulations is building a  million 
plant in Shasta Lake City Some  people have applied for the plants  
jobs 
Shasta Lake City too has its own utility but does not generate power It 
buys power from the federal government and also contracts with Enron for 
supplemental needs and is negotiating for more to ensure a hour operation 
for Knauf 
Reddings energy situation is enviable The REU reaches its demand peak at 
 megawatts in the summer when its has access to between  and  
megawatts said director Feider The excess is sold 
SELFSUFFICIENCY GOAL 
In the early s REU made a strategic decision to make costly capital 
expenditures so that it could be more selfsufficent instead of being subject 
to market conditions said Feider 
When the electricity deregulation bill was signed in  REU worried that 
with its debt of  million from those improvements it would be at risk in 
a competitive environment As a result it decided in  to eliminate it 
with a controversial  percent surcharge on customer bills 
The rates went from  cents a kilowatt hour to  cents and the plan in  
was for the surcharge to continue through  But Redding has prospered in 
the surplus power market and now expects to eliminate the surcharge in early 
 
Now if everything goes according to form the district could see a return to 
a rate of  cents said Feider 
Kevin Risse moved his Risse Racing a highend bicycle component 
manufacturer from Sunnyvale in June  We came up and heard the spiel 
and power was one thing and in hindsight it turned out to be pretty 
important said Risse 
In Sunnyvale his PGE bill was  a month In Redding he pays from  
to  monthly Risse moved from a square foot space to an 
squarefoot building and cut his rent by more than half It fell from 
 per square foot to  cents said Risse whose company builds bicycle 
shock absorbers and forks 
There are things we miss about the Bay Area culturally but at the same 
time I lived in Redwood City and sometimes it was a  minute commute and 
sometimes one hour and  minutes he said 
There are people who worked for me with rents going up and they are caught 
in a loop and theres nothing they can do But now theyre paying  a 
month in Redding rather than  in the Bay Area 
Chris King Precision Components also a maker of sophisticated bicycle 
components was synonymous with Santa Barbara for  years but the tight 
labor market and cost of living for bluecolor workers no longer made 
economic sense said King who now employes  people in Redding 
King said that in  he placed an ad for an assembly worker and got  
applications In  he placed the same ad and got one application The 
labor market was strangling us he said 
In Redding he received  applications for jobs at his plant where he 
will employ about  this summer But there is a lot of chaff in this 
area he said of the labor pool Its a lowcost area that has 
traditionally gone boom and bust mostly bust said King 
King said he is confident he can maintain a bluecollar workforce adequate to 
the test of manufacturing what he described as the Rolls Royce standard in 
the bicycle industry However he said he has concerns about his ability to 
attract higherpaid designers with degrees in mechanical engineering 
You can go skiing in  minutes and the environmental part of the equation 
is pretty incredible King said of the Shasta County area But theres no 
foreign film theater here no culture Theres middleclass shopping and you 
need to entertain executive people or engineers or creative people Unless 
they like fishing

Davis Powercrisis fixes almost finished 
By David Whitney
Bee Washington Bureau
Published Feb   
WASHINGTON  California Gov Gray Davis said Tuesday the state is two weeks 
to a month away from completing all the legislative fixes to its 
electricity crisis and that with a little luck and a lot of conservation 
he hopes to avoid power blackouts this summer when demand is at its peak 
I see light at the end of the tunnel and its not a train Davis said 
during a luncheon speech before the California State Society It is the 
lights staying on in the state But the governor who spent much of his time 
here at the National Governors Associations winter meeting fending off 
questions about the states power situation left for New York City on 
Tuesday afternoon without any firm endorsements from the Bush administration 
And despite his rosy recap of his administrations progress he acknowledged 
that difficult work remains before deals can be reached to revive 
cashstarved utilities teetering on bankruptcy particularly Pacific Gas and 
Electric Co 
Davis said that he thought he might have an agreement soon  perhaps by the 
end of the week  with Southern California Edison permitting it to sell 
revenue bonds to repay debts to power wholesalers in exchange for state 
acquisition of their electric transmission lines 
PGE is taking a little longer the governor said Its debt is two times 
as big Its a little more complicated situation  two three four weeks at 
the outside and well have PGE worked out 
PGE declined to comment on the governors timetable but spokesman John 
Nelson confirmed that company officials will take part in talks with the 
Governors Office this week 
Deals to take over the utilities power lines would put the state in the 
electricity transmission business even though its intention is to lease the 
daytoday operations back to the utilities But Davis said the deals would 
complete all the legislative fixes and put the state on course toward 
stabilizing supplies and price 
Does this mean we are home free and dont have to worry about anything the 
governor said No but it means we are basically on the downside of the 
problem 
Striking deals with the utilities is not the only remaining problem however 
State purchase of the transmission lines would require approval by the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
Davis was scouting for help Tuesday from Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham on 
that front 
In a brief meeting with reporters Davis described Abraham as open to the 
transmission line purchase Davis said he presented the secretary with a 
ninepage memo on the Southern California Edison transaction and Abraham 
said hed review it and get back to the governor by the end of the week 
If he would endorse the plan that would be a big leg up in terms of getting 
the FERCs approval Davis said even though Abraham cannot simply order the 
FERC to approve the deal I hope by the end of the week hell be able to 
endorse the proposal or at least endorse a modified proposal that is 
satisfactory to us 
In his speech to the California State Society an organization of 
Californians who live and work in the Washington area Davis said the state 
is on course to add new generating plants over three years so that supply 
exceeds demand 
But to make it through the summer Californians are going to have to work 
hard to reduce consumption he said Residences are being asked to curb usage 
by  percent and mechanisms are in place to squeeze similar savings from 
industries and commercial buildings through mandatory curtailments and cash 
incentives 
We are practicing what we preach Davis said 
He said his wife has turned down the thermostat in their home to  degrees 
I go to bed with a heavy sweat shirt on sweat pants three blankets and a 
comforter Davis said Going to the kitchen is like going to Antarctica My 
office is so dark at night you could develop film in it 
Davis meets today with analysts on Wall Street where he will carry forward 
the same message he delivered Tuesday  that California is on the road to 
energy selfsufficiency 
Well have utilities back in business paying their bills he said Well 
have longterm contracts for power at greatly reduced prices Well have a 
very aggressive conservation program And well have a public power authority 
not unlike New York the state of Washington and Tennessee

Published Wednesday February   
Davis passed up Duke Energys deals
The suppliers offers last summer could have helped avoid blackouts this year 
By Mike Taugher
TIMES STAFF WRITER 
As the California energy crisis was beginning to brew last summer one of the 
states largest electricity suppliers made Gov Gray Davis a pair of offers 
to smooth the states energy convulsions 
Looking back the governor may be regretting that he dismissed the proposals 
Duke Energy said it could sell enough electricity for  million homes for 
five years at what is now considered a very low price of  per 
megawatthour 
And Duke said that if the governor helped speed up permits the company could 
build enough new portable units to power an additional  homes 
Those offers embodied what has become two of the governors top strategies in 
dealing with the crisis  stabilizing the price of electricity through 
relatively longterm commitments and boosting generation to avoid blackouts 
this summer 
As it was though Duke spokesman Tom Williams said his company never 
received a response to its July  proposal 
In hindsight Davis inaction could prove costly The governors campaign to 
enter into longterm deals for electricity has produced just a handful of 
modest contracts and there is some doubt that the governors goal to speed 
up construction of small portable power plants to power millions of homes 
will be reached by summer 
Were pleased hes got that sense of urgency Williams said We displayed 
that sense of urgency on July  
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said at the time the offer was made Dukes 
proposal was expensive and there was uncertainty about how the energy crisis 
would take shape In hindsight the Duke proposal seems like the deal of the 
century today Maviglio said The question is wheres that offer today 
 Theyre not at the table now with a reasonable offer 
Had the governor decided to help Duke get permits for the new peaker 
plants he could already be halfway to his goal of getting  megawatts 
worth of new peaker plants by this summer 
Now however Duke says its offers are off the table The units the company 
would have used in California are now committed to the Midwest and Duke has 
become hesitant to invest more money in a state where it has more than  
million in uncollected power bills from the states utilities according to 
Williams 
Moreover Williams and others said it would be difficult for energy companies 
to meet Davis goal of  megawatts from new peaker power plants by summer 
because even under a new speedy permitting process announced by Davis three 
weeks ago it still can take months to line up equipment and get it 
constructed and on line 
The dilemma for California this summer shapes up like this various estimates 
predict that the amount of electricity that will be available will fall short 
of demand by  megawatts to nearly  megawatts or enough electricity 
to power  million to  million homes 
Davis has called for enough conservation to cut demand by  megawatts and 
has unveiled initiatives he hopes will boost generation by  megawatts 
If successful that would be enough to avoid rolling blackouts this summer 
according to state energy officials 
Nearly half of the new generation sought by Davis would come from peaker 
plants including  megawatts of new peaker plants that the governor 
wants to attract to the state and another  megawatts from peaker plants 
to be built by energy firms that have signed contracts with the California 
Independent System Operator 
There is uncertainty on both counts The Department of Water Resources which 
has stepped into the energybuying field because of the financial collapse of 
the utilities that have backed the ISOs purchasing is attempting to 
renegotiate some of the contracts energy companies entered into with the ISO 
That has alarmed some contractors 
And even if no agreements are scuttled through renegotiations with the water 
resources agency the ISO never figured on seeing all  megawatts it 
signed up for to actually materialize 
We viewed the prospect of getting all  megawatts as unlikely said 
Brian Theaker ISOs manager of reliability contracts It was going to be 
very difficult if not impossible for all  megawatts to hit the 
ground 
And even with a speedier licensing process it might be difficult to get the 
other  megawatts of new peakers built in time for summer 
If you dont have the equipment in hand its very difficult to get it at 
this late stage of the game Theaker said citing conversations with 
industry officials 
Still state officials are confident that the governors goals to boost power 
production from peaker plants and through increased energy conservation will 
work 
With increased generation and the reduction in demand we should be able to 
avoid rolling blackouts this summer said Energy Commission spokeswoman 
Claudia Chandler 
Chandler said the new peaker plants which can be transported on a flatbed 
truck and can be as small as a large backyard storage shed still could be 
running by summer if applications are filed by midApril 
But the Energy Commission has yet to receive a single application for a new 
peaker power plant 
That kind of is putting us on pins and needles Chandler said We are 
talking to developers though They indicate they will be submitting 
applications late this week or next 
Meanwhile Davis met in Washington DC with Energy Secretary Spencer 
Abraham to discuss Californias plans to buy  miles of electricity 
transmission lines now owned by three financially troubled utility companies 
Speculation has surfaced in recent days that federal regulators are opposed 
to the plan and would reject it Curtis Hebert the chairman of the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission has said the state takeover of the lines would 
be against the best interests of the American public 
A spokeswoman for the regulatory commission said Tuesday the panel has not 
discussed or taken a position on the California plan 
Hilary McLean a spokeswoman for the governor characterized Davis meeting 
with Abraham as productive and said the two had pledged to work together 
and continue discussing the issue 
Davis is scheduled today to fly to New York where he will meet with Wall 
Street analysts before flying back to California tonight

Davis fights for backing takes state plan to DC 



Lots of people in capital wary of transmissiongrid takeover
By Toby Eckert
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE 
February   
WASHINGTON  Gov Gray Davis worried about possible federal opposition to 
the states plan to take control of Californias power transmission system 
said he will lobby Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham on the plan in a meeting 
today 
Clearly we have to persuade lots of people in Washington that what were 
doing is the right thing Davis said yesterday citing recent news reports 
that indicate opposition to the plan from the head of the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission or FERC 
The commission appears to have authority over approving the plan 








Hydropower net needs a miracle 
Edison No more money to bury power lines underground 
 



After joining other governors in a wideranging meeting with President Bush 
at the White House Davis also said there may be some give on the Bush 
administrations opposition to price controls on wholesale electricity if 
power generators are assured a healthy profit He did not elaborate 
A White House spokeswoman said she was unaware of any change in the 
administrations stance on price controls 
FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert has declined to comment on how the commission 
might rule on Californias plan to acquire  miles of utilityowned 
electricity transmission lines as part of a strategy for solving the states 
power crisis 
But in an interview with the Dow Jones news service last week he indicated 
the plan may run counter to FERCs policy of encouraging the development of 
regional transmission organizations or RTOs to manage access to power 
grids 
Anything that moves in the opposite direction of RTOs  is against the 
best interests of the American public he was quoted as saying 
Davis said Heberts comments raised concerns in my mind And I want 
Secretary Abraham to understand the motivation for doing this is to solve the 
problem allow the utilities to get back into business pay off the 
generators and the banks and begin to stabilize the market 
While Abraham does not have direct authority over the issue he is part of an 
energy policy team appointed by Bush Davis sees winning Abrahams backing of 
the plan as a possible key to federal approval 
I think that teams assessment of the progress were making will have a lot 
to do with how Washington responds including the FERC Davis said 
Davis will also pitch his plans for ending the crisis to Wall Street analysts 
tomorrow However he said he had no meetings planned with FERC officials 
The Democratic governor acknowledged that many California Republicans are 
philosophically opposed to the state buying the transmission lines 
Some people in Washington I think see this as more of an ideological 
statement by the Democratcontrolled state government Davis said As a 
governor I see it as a practical solution to a problem were trying to deal 
with 
The state wants to acquire the transmission system from Pacific Gas and 
Electric Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric as a 
condition for helping the utilities pay off some  billion in debt they 
have accumulated The debt is a product of soaring costs for wholesale power 
that the utilities have been unable to fully recover from consumers under 
state law 
Davis announced a tentative agreement last week to buy Edisons power lines 
for  billion 
The purchase plan also will allow the state to upgrade the transmission 
system and fix bottlenecks in the flow of electricity within California and 
from neighboring states such as Arizona Davis said 
He and other governors stressed the importance of improving the power grid in 
a discussion yesterday with Abraham Environmental Protection Agency 
Administrator Christie Whitman and Interior Secretary Gale Norton 
Well need federal approval and hopefully federal assistance on the 
financing of those improvements in California Davis said 
The governor has tangled with FERC on numerous aspects of the power crisis 
The commission which has authority over the wholesale power market has 
resisted Davis proposal to cap wholesale prices in the West Bush and 
Abraham have too 
But Davis suggested that temporary costplus price limits  in which 
wholesale rates would reflect the cost of producing the power plus a set 
profit margin  may still be an option 
In San Diego yesterday House Speaker Dennis Hastert RIll emphasized that 
California needed to resolve its own energy problems and rework its 
deregulation plan But Hastert held out the possibility of caps on the 
wholesale price of electricity which have bipartisan support from California 
representatives and senators 
Maybe we can do that on a shortterm focused way but you have to go back 
and fix the legislation Hastert said in a meeting with The San Diego 
UnionTribunes editorial board 
Davis indicated that he discussed the power crisis in general terms with Bush 
and would have a more detailed talk with Abraham 
Bush invited me to call on him directly if we need more assistance Davis 
said
 



Duke Energy Suspends Suits Vs Calif



LOS ANGELES AP via NewsEdge Corporation  
Duke Energy Corp suspended a lawsuit against
the state on Monday after the California Department of Water
Resources agreed to buy power from Duke that was formerly being
provided under contracts with two financially troubled utilities


Duke said Monday it will suspend until April  its lawsuit
against Gov Gray Davis who had commandeered Dukes longterm
energy contracts with Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas
and Electric


Duke sued Davis after the governor announced plans to allow the
California Power Exchange to sell the contracts as a way to pay
debts owed by SoCal Edison and PGampE The power generator argued
that Davis exceeded his authority under the states Emergency
Services Act


Under a settlement announced Monday the water resources
department will buy power on behalf of residential and business
customers that was previously being delivered to Edison and PGampE


We see this as progress Its a step that takes us in the
positive direction said Roger Salazar spokesman for Davis


Bill Hall head of Dukes California operations said the
agreement gives California consumers the benefit of the longterm
contract price that was negotiated with the utilities before they
defaulted And it allows Duke to provide electricity through an
entity that can pay us for it


SoCal Edison and PGampE Californias two biggest utilities have
lost nearly  billion in part because the states deregulation
plan prohibits them from passing on skyrocketing wholesale power
prices to consumers


With SoCal Edison and PGampE near bankruptcy the California
Department of Water Resources was authorized last month to buy
power


Duke said the interim settlement expires April  when a court
hearing on Dukes suit is scheduled in US District Court in Los
Angeles


Also on Monday Duke suspended a case it brought against the
California Independent System Operator which manages  percent of
the states power grid


Duke and other power generators sued the ISO after the water
resources department said it would not pay for power bought on the
expensive spot market The ISO had said it would bill the nearly
bankrupt utilities for that power


When power generators tried to pull out of the spot market the
ISO sued and a federal judge ordered companies to keep selling to
the state That order was allowed to expire last week while the
state and the generators work on a settlement



Calif Optimistic About Power Line



By DAVID HO
Associated Press Writer
WASHINGTON AP via NewsEdge Corporation  
California Gov Gray Davis said Tuesday that
he is confident the Bush administration will support the states
 billion proposal to ease energy woes by buying Southern
California Edisons electricity transmission system


Supporters of the plan say it could lead to quick improvements
of a bottlenecked system overdue for repairs But critics contend
the proposal saddles the state with an antiquated network that
could prove costly to fix


Davis said he presented a ninepage proposal to Energy Secretary
Spencer Abraham and he expects a response by the end of the week


Abraham wants this problem solved and hes been very
supportive Davis said Hes recommended approval on every
request Ive made and I believe he will support our proposal


Energy Department spokesman Joe Davis said Abraham is reviewing
the proposal but wouldnt comment on whether he would endorse it


On Friday the governor announced a deal to purchase the power
lines and require Edison International the utilitys parent
company to sell cheap power to the state for a decade


Federal approval is required for the proposal which does not
include the states other major investorowned utilities Pacific
Gas amp Electric and San Diego Gas and Electric


Negotiations are continuing with all three utilities to buy
their  miles of transmission lines for a cost that could
range from  billion to  billion


Edison and PGampE have said they have accumulated nearly 
billion in losses because the states  deregulation law
prevented them from passing the true costs of wholesale energy to
their customers The governors plan would infuse the utilities
with part of the cash they need to remain solvent


Some state lawmakers have said the longterm costs of the plan
outweigh the immediate benefits because the transmission lines need
repairs that could cost an estimated  billion a year


Addressing a lunch for the California State Society attended by
members of the states congressional delegation Davis outlined his
plans to solve the power problems by building new power plants and
working with the energy industry


We have a real challenge this summer and the following
summer he said The third year I think enough generation will
be online so that were in much better shape


Davis has issued executive orders to shorten the approval
process for new plants and expects to gain  megawatts by
summer  enough to power about  million homes


In addition to increasing power production Davis emphasized the
need for greater conservation advising his states consumers to
turn off lights in empty rooms unplug unused appliances and lower
thermostats


In my house my wife has the thermostat down to  degrees
he said Going to the kitchen in the middle of the night is like
a trip to Antarctica

Constellation to Build Major Plant in California 
First in Over a Decade

by Will McNamara 
Director Electric Industry Analysis

Constellation Energy Group NYSE CEG announced that Kiewit Industrial 
Company of Omaha Neb will begin construction in early April of the MW 
High Desert power plant near Victorville Calif The project which has been 
in development since the mids by High Desert Power Project LLCa 
subsidiary of Constellation Energy Group of Baltimore Mdwill be the first 
new major power plant to serve the Southern California area in more than a 
decade 

Analysis The fact that California suffers from a significant supply   demand 
imbalance and that no new major power plant has been built in the state in 
over a decade has been well documented in the energy industry press 
Consequently the fact that Constellation Energy Group is now close to 
breaking ground on its new plant having completed the laborious plant siting 
requirements in California is a majorand somewhat surprisingcoup for the 
company considering that its generation expertise has primarily been in the 
Northeast nuclear industry Constellation Energy Group has said that it will 
market power from the plant within California which should prove to be a win 
  win scenario for both the company and the state 

The High Desert power plant will be built on a acre site at the Southern 
California Logistics Airport formerly known as the George Air Force Base 
Commercial operation of the plant is scheduled for June  The plants 
electric generating technology is based on cleanburning natural gasfired 
combustion turbines operating in a combinedcycle mode Part of the current 
supply problem in California is the fact that hydroelectric resources the 
states primary energy source have been in short supply due to 
lowerthanaverage rainfall over the last year Moving away from a dependency 
on hydroelectric supply may be a smart move for the state In addition the 
High Desert plant is consistent with a national trend that supports natural 
gas as the fuel of choice for new power plant development projects As a 
point of interest according to data from the Energy Information 
Administration Californias fuel mix is primarily based in a mixture of 
natural gas  percent hydro  percent nuclear  percent 
coal  percent oil  percent and other presumably renewable 
sources  percent 

It is rather surprising that Constellation would be the first company to 
build a major power plant in California in over a decade considering the 
companys consistent geographic and fuelmix focus Constellation Energy 
Group is a holding company that includes a group of competitive energy 
businesses focused mostly on wholesale power marketing merchant generation 
and portfolio management in North America Constellation Energy Group is the 
parent company of the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company BGE a regulated 
gas and electric delivery company serving Central Maryland Up until this 
point Constellations generation assets have been primarily based in a 
mixture of coal and nuclear and for the most part located in the 
Northeastern United States According to information directly from the 
company itself Constellations own fuel mix is predominantly coal  
percent followed by nuclear  percent Oil gas and hydro only represent 
a small percentage  percent of Constellations fuel mix 

Although coal is the primary fuel in Constellations portfolio over the last 
year the company has become more focused on nuclear For instance last 
December Constellation Nuclear a wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation 
Energy Group announced its intent to purchase  percent of Unit  and  
percent of Unit  of the Nine Mile Point nuclear power plant Once the deal 
is closed in mid Constellation will own a total of  MW of Nine 
Mile Points  MW of total generating capacity The nuclear plant 
purchases that Constellation is making expand upon its Calvert Cliffs asset 
an MW twounit nuclear plant in Southern Maryland When I wrote about 
this acquisition last December I noted that while Constellation will most 
likely retain its coalfired generation assets the company appeared to be 
moving closer toward a nuclearbased portfolio 

In addition in early  Constellation began a restructuring of its 
corporate identity dividing its operations into two separate segments one 
focused on its merchant energy business including Constellation Nuclear and 
the other focused on regional retail energy services The merchant energy 
business was ranked fifth in the nation for sales of electric power in the 
third quarter of  and the company is committed to expanding this growth 
The goal for the merchant energy business according to Constellation Energy 
Group CEO Christian Poindexter is to establish a portfolio of over  MW 
of electric generation facilities by  Toward that end Constellation 
acknowledged earlier that it would be taking advantage of bargain prices for 
nuclear plants which resulted in large part from other utilities focusing 
on transmission operations and thus choosing or being mandated to divest 
their generation plants  Constellation in the past has justified its move in 
this direction by saying that its experience has found that nuclear fuel is 
cheaper than coal and gas generators and that the economics of nuclear are 
quite robust once they are calculated out  

However considering that there is only a limited number of nuclear plants in 
the United States that will become available for purchase Constellation 
Energy Group may have recognized the need to become even more diversified 
The California market despite its stringent plant siting requirements 
arguably offered an appropriate market for Constellation to become more 
diversified Given the states environmental lobbying presence it is 
doubtful that a nuclear plant could have been approved in California 
Although natural gas is not a primary fuel source for Constellation as a 
company it is the preferred source for new power plants Therefore the High 
Desert plant given that it will be fired by natural gas presumably stood a 
greater chance of navigating through Californias plant siting requirements 
than a coal or nuclear plant could have In fact in the announcement of 
the plant Constellation noted that having received all federal state and 
local approvals the High Desert plant will be a good neighbor in the 
community with no significant environmental impacts 

The announcement of Constellations new plant could not come at a better time 
for California of course Although the plant wont be operational until June 
 the state can use the good publicity now A new report from the 
Cambridge Energy Research Associates CERA says that it is already too late 
for the state to head off a serious summer shortage that could lead to at 
least  hours of rolling blackouts Its too late for this summer 
declared Lawrence J Makovich of CERA referring to the states desperate 
efforts to ramp up power supplies for the short term The source of 
Californias farreaching power crisis is a shortage At least  
megawatts of new generating facilities are required to restore balance to the 
states grid Instead according to the report demand will exceed supply by 
 MW which will cause the state to be under an energy alert of some sort 
for at least  hours 

CERAs report came out on the heels of Calif Gov Gray Davis pledge to have 
 MW of new generating capacity available in California by July more 
than double the amount expected just a few months ago Davis said the new 
plants would provide enough electricity to ward off blackouts this summer 
which CERA obviously disputes Davis announced a series of orders intended to 
bring online  MW by July  with an additional  MW by July 
  

In any event as California continues to struggle from a severe supply   
demand imbalance the announcement of Constellations new plant appears to be 
good news for all the parties involved Gov Davis has pledged to support an 
expedited approval process for additional plants so it will be interesting 
to see which company is given approval to proceed with the next power plant 
in the state It will also be interesting to see based on Constellations 
plant and others that may be built whether or not the economics of building 
such plants in California will prove beneficial Other power suppliers may 
opt to merely enter into longterm sales agreements with the state rather 
than invest the resources that building a power plant would require

Hello to the Direct Access Coalition

Below you will find a summary of the press strategy that Edelman Public
Relations intends to employ over the coming weeks in collaboration with the
Alliance for Retail Energy Markets and the broader Direct Access Coalition
I will also outline the information that I need from Direct Access Coalition
members who are willing to be involved in media outreach and interviews
And finally I have attached supporting documents that you can use as
background material to prep for your responses to any media inquiries that
you may receive

This Week

   We are drafting a pitch letter to send out by the end of this week
via blast email and fax to the following media lists capitol press corps
reporters  mainstream media reporters working the energy crisis and 
trade media  We may also outreach to our editorial board list as well  Our
pitch will be focused on what it will really mean for small business and CI
customers to lose the option of retail choice at a time when they are
suffering the financial hardships of skyrocketing energy bills We will
address the effect on Californias future business climate if direct access
is not preserved through legislation that corrects the problems that ABx
caused for retail choice  And finally we will address the point that no
matter what direction California ultimately takes direct access must be a
part of the solution  Reporters have seen the recent polls which illustrate
California businesses concerns with the path the state is on so this is a
prime opportunity to build on those recent media stories

    We recommend a conference call with AReM and the Direct Access
Coalition on Friday to address the questions and suggestions on the press
strategy outlined here

     Determine which people in the Direct Access Coalition are willing to
take media calls on behalf of the coalition

Next Week

   Follow up with key reporters who received the pitch letter

   Evaluate the language of SB x and determine whether there will be an
opportunity to hold a news conference with Sen Bowen in the near future
Monitor movement at the PUC and determine whether a press conference may be
effective in this arena or whether we may need to use the option of sending
a media alert before the March  hearing followed by a news release after
the hearing

   Place opeds opinion pieces with key newspapers

   Contact radio news shows and TV public affairs shows ie California
Capitol Week and the California Report to secure
media interviews

    Revise the SB x fact sheet attached to reflect the realities of
the amended language in SB x

 What We Need From You

  If you are willing to speak with the media or you have
customers clients with a positive direct access story to tell please
respond to this email as soon as you can with your name and contact
information

  If you have draft opeds written that need to be placed with newspapers
on behalf of your association and the broader coalition we are willing to
do this for the you

  If you have colleagues and or staff that are already working with the
media it would be helpful to have this information so that we can
collaborate as necessary

The Documents Below

  All documents are works in progress so if you have suggestions on
 potential changes please feel free to share them with us

ABX  Hertzberg was just scheduled for hearing this afternoon in the
Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee  In brief the bill
does the following

Require as a condition of certification by the CEC that an applicant
offer to sell to an electrical
corporation a municipal corporation or the Department of Water
Resources at a just and reasonable cost base price electrical power
generated by the facility

This bill would also prohibit a person or entity as defined from
operating an electrical generation facility unless the person or entity
has submitted to the commission within the time prescribed by
regulations adopted by the commission a maintenance and outage
schedule and the commission has approved that schedule

Dear Steve

This is Amy Kim I am borrowing this email address for the next
week and a half  I was a Summer Associate with the CALME
Group as it was known then this past summer  I was introduced
to you by Michael Moran  As you may recall I interviewed with
you back in September for a possible position within your division
for this summer  Again I appreciate you fitting me into your busy
schedule  I enjoyed our conversation about the East Asian
economy

You asked that I keep in touch with you throughout the last year of
my studies  I recently spoke with Michael Moran to get his opinion
on how best to contact you  He suggested that I email you with
an update as to how Im doing and of my continued interest in
working in Government Affairs and Regulations

I will be graduating this June with a JD and PhD in Political
Science  I will be taking the bar exam for New York and
Massachusetts  I would like to express my interest in joining your
group  I feel that working within your group would provide me with
the opportunity to incorporate my vast knowledge of the political
arena as well as my interest in international law environment
energy etc

I hope that you still consider me a good candidate for this position
I look forward to your reply

Regards


Amy Kim

I asked our consultant who provided assistance on the NEPCO project in 
Pakistan to give us some thoughts on Dabhol  I have also discussed this with 
Pete van de Gohm and he is working with Steve Reistetter at EECC  Our 
thoughts are that we really need the DPC folks in Mumbai involved as they 
will have to liaise with the authorities  They probably are already 
involved but nobodys bringing me into the loop from that end

Dear Mike

Im probably not going to tell you anything you havent thought of but
heres my response

Doesnt sound too good  These groups have been losing out in the great
transition between Nehruvian mercantilesocialism and the current effort to
get Indiaat least half wayinto the world economy  Some of their
demonstrations in Andhra Pradesh recently turned violent  These also were
focused on privatization issues and the decline of the stateowned sector
where these groups dominate  These groups have allies in the more radical
environmental groups  They are trying to revive their political base and in
India theres nothing like a big American company to focus on particularly
on the issue of electricity ratessomething that affects everybody

Not being familiar with the site access or connections to the outside world
I cant comment on those aspects  I assume Dabhol has a PR effort going to
show how Maharashtra people and industry need reliable supplies of
electricity etc

Generally I think you have to plan for the worst but look for avenues to
reduce tensionsopen up a back channel to the leaders now hold any
demonstration well short of the perimeter but let a small group in to
present petitions etc

Make sure the state level politicians and senior bureaucrats guarantee the
facility will be protected  If something really big seems to be in the
works see if they will put the plant and surrounding area under Section 
or whatever the successor emergency regulation isit prohibits meetings
and allows the police to break up demonstrations before they get started
Work with the State Home Secretary and district level Superintendent of
Police to make sure sufficient police will be on site to hold the perimeter
and protect key facilitiesthe control room fuel supply plant

Above all make sure an experienced senior majestrate will be on site
empowered to raise the level of responsebut only if really needed  The
Indians have a welldeveloped command and control system for these kinds of
demonstrations  Escalation starts at baton charging and moves on to tear
gas  If the police are attacked violently and have difficulty holding the
majestrate can order live firing over the heads of the demonstrators  If
police are in danger of being overrun and suffering casualties the
majestrate can order firing into the mob  Obviously you dont want things
to go that far  There are lots of tactical possibilities in the early stages
and cagey police officers will use them

These are things the police and majestrates can do but which your own
security force is not legally empowered to do at least outside the
perimeter  Your counsel in Maharashtra can tell you what are the legalities
of your own security force using force to protect your property  Based on
that you can take the appropriate steps to deploy your own security force

In the vast majority of cases these kinds of demonstrations are contained
without much problem  Very occasionally they do get out of handand one
has to be ready for that

Hope this helps

Dear Ms Williamson

    Per an autoresponder from Yorleni Mendez I am forwarding to you
what I sent to Enron  others a couple of days ago which was in
supplement to what I sent on Feb th  Time is of the essence and not
on your side  Nor are the facts  the law on your side  Therefore you
need to find a way to get us to be on your side

    Due to the urgency and foreseeable and announced forthcoming event
horizons I believe you may wish to provide copies of the attached to
the proper persons at Enron for their immediate attention  Please let
them know that if I have to continue to give information  documents to
the US Senate and the proper others that I will do so and then also
show that the failure of Hughes interests companies to take remedial
measures was indeed blatant refusal  We have already logged where
Hughes companies interests have been to
http  willgriffincom hugheshtm thus you might as well continue to
visit there and see where we have posted changes and new information
The knowledge of the Hughes companies interests of these matters is now
clearly established  Weve already submitted some of our visitor logs
and other documents to the proper others establishing the knowledge of
Hughes companies interests to others  This is something I am sure will
be most meaningful to the lawyers along with a few other things Im
sure which will get their attention

    Also please have someone forward the attached to William Rice
Lummis James A Baker and others and advise them that surprises
attention getters  wakeup calls are just around the corner  They need
to contact us soon before it becomes improper to discuss how a
reasonable fanny  facingsaving resolve for Hughes
interests companies may be achieved

Subject Advisory of Your Legal Political Exposures Coming True

Dear Hughes Electronics Enron HHMI and Hughes Lawyers et al

    I am fully aware how many of the Hughes interests visited
http  willgriffincom hugheshtm after I sent you an email on Feb 
 advising you of your impending difficulties and exposures

    I have made some changes to these Hughes related pages including
posting my advisory to you to http  willgriffincom lettertohtm for
your convenience and reference with active email links to you and each
other

    Also since I contacted you last week the next day Enron has been
in the news as being the biggest beneficiary of the California energy
woes while also being the largest contributor fundraiser and general
benefactor to President George W Bush
http  wwwmercurycentercom premium business docs enronhtm
Another article goes even further showing the relationship of James
Addison Baker III to Enron and Hughes Bushs Biggest Donors Gain From
High Prices in California Crunch
http  wwwvillagevoicecom issues  ridgewayshtml

    You may wish to revisit the updated
http  willgriffincom hugheshtm refesh reload the page to clear your
browsers cache of the previous copy after reviewing the news articles
links about Enron provided above  You should know and reasonably
foresee that you are not the only visitors to my Hughes pages  You
should also know that Ive had contact with the proper authorities and
this to include correspondences within this past week  Then again Im
sure many in the pipeline of those who review this and my previous
advisory know this to be true or to reasonably foresee the interest of
many others at a minimum

    I believe you to foresee more to soon become public difficulties for
you and that the intensity will no doubt increase significantly  You
should know that any political related problems will include Democrats
in volumes but there exists quite a few Republicans who will disavow
and distance themselves from you  The ChinaHughes missile  satellite
technology transfers that were cited in the Cox Committee report and
the arming of Sadaam Hussein with Hughes technologies issues are about
to pop up their heads and see a longer shadow than the groundhog
recently did  This in addition to the recent articles about Enron
current activities and forthcoming event horizons is not good news for
Hughes interests

    You just might want to ask William Rice Lummis and James A Baker
III et al how they intend to solicit the help of the guy who holds
the keys to resolve who theyve got a little miffed at them because of
what was done to him in an ad hominem attempt  Certainly when it is
true that if he now does nothing and a profound correlation exists
between how bad things go for you and how good things go as a result for
him then why should he help yall  It appears if you ask Mr Baker
about the Matter of Hughes and how we hold the keys to an amiable
resolve that he will stipulate that it will take some real Politics of
Diplomacy to persuade us to help you but that this needs to be
urgently accomplished

		 Subject Tax Lobbying Initiative for Generation Finance Vehicle

Steve

Im sending this memo to you as a reminder of our one minute conversation in 
the garage last night

Background
Going back almost three years John Stinebaugh and I started looking for a 
more efficient method to finance generation projects  We explored two 
avenues creating a Master Limited Partnership MLP or a Real Estate 
Investment Trust REIT to own the projects with Enron as a manager  The 
advantages of a MLP or a REIT structure are twofold i they provide direct 
access to the public equity markets and ii they provide a lower cost of 
equity capital because earnings are taxed at the equity holder level not 
at the MLP REIT level ie you do not have double taxation on earnings as 
with a publically held C corporation  John and I pursued these avenues 
with Jordan Mintz because we wanted to create an offbalance sheet vehicle 
that would provide a lower overall cost of capital so that ENA could be more 
competitive in bidding for acquisitions  The same vehicle would also have 
provided another exit vehicle for the peakers or other assets that ENA was 
developing at the time

Jordan explored both MLP and REIT avenues  The MLP was quickly disqualified 
because electric generation and transmission assets do not qualify as assets 
that can be financed using an MLP structure  The REIT structure was more 
promising to the point where Jordan had prepared and submitted a request for 
a private letter ruling from the IRS allowing certain types of generating 
assets to be placed into REIT  Unfortunately the IRS ruled against our 
request

Concept
There would still be real value to Enron in having the tax laws changed to 
allow generation and transmission assets to be placed into either a REIT or 
an MLP  ENA holds economic interests in QFs in third party nonutility 
vehicles  Being able to package these into an MLP REIT would provide a good 
exit strategy for these and other investments we may acquire in the future  
Other efforts such as building controlling transmission or 
purchasing developing coalfired generation projects would also benefit from 
access to cheaper equity capital

The public policy benefit is pretty clear  Avoiding double taxation of 
profits dividends would lower the cost of equity capital invested in 
generation and transmission assets  This in turn should have a beneficial 
effect on encouraging construction of new and badly needed generation and 
transmission assets by lowering the equity return that holders of these 
assets would require  You could even take existing rateregulated utility 
generation and transmission assets and lower rates by placing these assets 
into MLPs or REITS by eliminating the federal and state taxes that are 
factored into rates to give utilities their aftertax allowed rates of return

Given the recent attention on California and deregulation in general 
creating more taxefficient ownership vehicles for these assets could provide 
a way to lower costs without having states acquire these assets and gain 
financing advantages through taxexempt bond issues

Conclusion
Given the momentum that may be gathering for new tax legistlation coupled 
with the growing concer over energy policy it may be a good time to float 
this change in tax law  It could reasonably be argued that it would assist 
in directing capital into increasing generation transmission supply one of 
the key issues for California  Jordan can update you further on what we have 
done in the past and what would need to be changed in the tax laws

some of the potential of various Energy Programs that are being considered
by  the Office of Strategic Center for Natural Gas and with Abbie Layne
Product ManagerAdvanced Heat Engines

Mr Anderson
Product Manager
Natural Gas Infrastructure Reliability
Would like to discus some of the following topics

 Expected increases in the use of natural gas and projected availability of
this fuel

 Any special issues associated with distributed generation that could be
addressed with new technologies

 Concerns about the current price and availability of natural gas causing
on new gasfired power initiatives

 Interdependence issues between gas and electric power

 Any specific natural gas infrastructure issues facing these companies

 The most important issue concerning natural gas reliability

 Leadership in RD

 Future technology needs and

 The NETL role in technology development to meet future industry needs

Mark Williams
Product Manager
Fuel Cells
Would like to discus some of the following topics

  Fuel Cell Distributed Generation DG benefits

 DG deployment allows critical industry to stay at current location even if
local grid is unstable and unreliable

 DG deployment obviates need for RD investment

 Fuel cell DG deployment means being able to site power with no air
permitting required

 High fuel cell efficiency reduces operating costs for fuel which is
important where gas is expensive  Additionally  high efficiency
utilization frees up natural gas for use at other critical locations

 Use of zero or low emission fuel cell technology in environmentally
constrained areas permits continued use of other  high emitting generating
plants thus increasing the overall power available

 Fuel cell DG deployment puts the highest quality power in the system
increasing grid reliability and stability and

 Fuel cell attributes also enhance grid reliability through lower
harmonics variability control and voltage control

Abbie Layne Product Manager
Advanced Heat Engines
Would like to discus some of the following topics

 New developments in Gas Turbines

 Increasing Reliability and Maintainability of Gas Turbines

 Combined Cycle Power Plants Increasing Efficiency

 Hybrid Power Systems

 Condition Monitoring Systems


This meeting would be for about  hours at ENRONs  facilities The
meetings  arranged for March  morning

A dinner for the DOE is planned at our home at the Huntingdon  Kirby

I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail  If 
you need to call with questions my home number is 









As far as recommendations here is a short list

   Examine LDCs incentive rate program  Current methodology rewards sales 
above monthly index without enough consideration of future 
      replacement cost  The result is that the LDCs sell gas that should be 
injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index
                    This creates a shortage in later months

   California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet 
demand  Investigate why it wasnt maximized operationally  
                      Specific questions should include  

    Why in March May   werent total system receipts higher in order 
to fill storage

    Why are there so many examples of OFOs on weekends that push away too 
much gas from Socals system  
       I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their 
own demand  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than 
their injection capablity but injected far less

   Similar to the power market  there is too much benchmarking to short 
term prices  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major 
                    LDCs  By design the customers are short at a floating 
rate  This market has been long historically  It has been a buyers market 
and the 
     consumer has benefitted  


Call me if you need any more input

Thanks"
2001-02-15T00:22:00-08:00,"Sen Wyden called Jeff Skilling and I subsequently spoke to his staffer 
Joshua Sheinkman

As you know Wyden wants to introduce legislation to facilitate disclosure of 
operating information about the electric grid and is now looking for more 
details  Wyden is not interested in pressing for additional disclosure of 
financial information
The additional details they are looking for include what information should 
be made available when should it be made available how should it be made 
available and who should make it available  On this last point I suggested 
that the legislation should apply to the transmission system operator 
whoever that is ie it could be an investor owned utility a publiclyowned 
utility an ISO or an RTO  I also pointed out that FERC could make this 
happen by itself except in the case of public utilities like BPA  Extending 
FERC jurisdiction to these entities could be among the main benefits of the 
legislation
Alan please pull together the recommendations on each of these issues and 
forward to Linda Linda after we have the information and perhaps some 
legislative language to go with it please forward to Joshua at 

Wyden would like our help in getting Sen Nickles to cosponsor the 
legislation  Linda
It may also be useful to suggest a letter from wyden to FERC asking them to 
use their existing authority to start these disclosures as soon as possible

Hi Steve 
    Folks love Newsome and I think hes very nice and appears to be very 
free market  Spears the other Republican appointee is not at all free 
market in my view  I would not like this to mentioned anywhere else but I 
have found that the farm reps on the Commission may sound deregulatory but 
are not and have been really troublesome without a good free market person 
on board  And there are no truly free market persons on  board at the 
Commission every single other agricultural rep that I worked with on the 
Commission were trouble even though they claimed to be deregulatory  and 
they were far worse before I got there and after I left  
    I visited with Newsome a day before Inauguration and I was appalled at 
what they were planning to do concerning agency structure  that would have 
elevated the regulatory lawyers and diminished the role of the economists at 
the agency  Misguided and showed to me a lack of understanding of how 
organizational structures can affect what comes out of an agency  
    I am often at odds with the industry view regarding CFTC issues  I 
dont think the futures exchanges who have a lot of power necessarily are 
procompetition and many of the nonexchange folks who lobby on CFTC issues 
are Washington or New York Democrat  which is why they want to involve Ken 
at this level lawyers who do not understand markets and who are more 
interested in being able to claim influence or impact  The CFTC is in awful 
shape  the quality of staff is horrendous and the Commission is relying on 
some of the worst people for their policy work same folks that Brooksley 
Born used same folks who have advocated more regulation of the OTC market 
for years  Many quality folks do not want the job as Chairman because its 
been such a backwater  I am looking for some good folks  Have  at least one 
person who would be good at that job  And its not Newsome  Please do not 
share this information with the usual folks as they hate me anyway Im too 
free market and have argued against their fixes  Sorry for this scathing 
review but this is an important appointment  Wendy

Steve

Actually EOL and other units of Enron have declined to participate and 
specifically asked not to be included in the press release  Confidentially 
this is a case of a developer overselling use of the Enron name for 
approximately  million equity stake  We have caught him in many half 
truths and are uncomfortable going too far with this since we might get be 
placed in an awkward position  Because of EOL and our own concerns we 
intentionally toned it down  I believe in fact that it is just another 
platform as well as an investment  Consequently we would prefer to keep 
this to the minimum of allowing them to issue a press release as included in 
the contract  Your concurrence would be appreciated  I am available if you 
wish to discuss this further

Jim Newsome is currently the Interim Chair of the Commodities Futures Trading 
Commission CFTC  He was appointed in  to term which expires in June 
  Commissioner Newsome visited Enron in  and will again visit Enron 
to meet with Jeff Skilling also EnronOnLine executives on March  

The CFTC has  Commissioners  Commissioners Newsome and Spears are 
Republicans and Commissioners Erickson and Holum are Democrats with one 
opening  If Newsome becomes Chair then there will be two open seats  If 
Newsome if passed over there will only be open seat 

Commissioner Newsome has the support of Majority Trent Lott  He is well 
liked in industry because of his free market philosophy and belief in 
competition and deregulation  While not a technical expert he is a known 
quantity at the Commission  Newsome played a major role in the Commodities 
Futures Modernization Act CFMA which became law last Congress  This law 
brought legal certainty and modernization to the commodity trading 
community  With Newsome industry is consulted before regulations are 
issued  Industry generally believes that Commission Newsome is the right 
candidate to oversee the CFMA rulekmaking which is currently underway

The other candidate for the position was former North Carolina Senator Lauch 
Faircloth whose nomination was being championed by Senator Phil Gramm 
RTX  We have learned that Faircloth has lost interest because he would 
have to divest sizeable interest in agriculture holdings  The concern now is 
that because this is a third tier appointment  unknown candidates will 
suddenly appear without industry input  A quick nomination and confirmation 
of Commissioner Newsome as Chairman is recommended by many in the industry

Do you think it appropriate to have Ken Lay raise this nomination with the 
transition team

		 Subject Conf Call with CalPERS

FROM SHIRLEY HUDLER

Dave Marty Richard Steve and Bill

Thank you for taking the time this Thursday the th to spend time discussing 
the California situation with CalPERS   The call is scheduled for  CST 
and will last at least an hour possibly more  

By way of background ENE and CalPERS are   partners in JEDI II  which 
was created in December   JEDI II is a funding vehicle for Enrons 
energy related merchant investments  Transactions of note are   
minority equity interest in EES equity ownership in Quanta  ownership 
of East Coast Power since sold down to  and participation in a number 
of EP drilling partnerships and coal investments  The commitment period was 
set to expire on December    and was extended to March     In 
addition CalPERS invested  Million in The New Power Co prior to the 
IPO   Andy and I are working with CalPERS to amend the current JEDI II 
partnership in order that we continue our successful relationship with 
CalPERS  The Alternative Investment Management AIM staff that we work with 
are very supportive of Enron and we are looking at a number of opportunities 
to put their money to work in our businesses  

CalPERS hasnt provided any specific questions that they want answered  My 
thoughts on how to structure the call is for Marty to spend some time talking 
about California Enrons role there and our view of the situation  Then 
Richard could address the regulatory status in California  I would expect 
this to be somewhat of a freeform conference call  One area we may discuss 
is how Enron and CalPERS can team up on a California initiative  The AIM 
staff is interested in discussing this particular point  

The following individuals from CalPERS senior staff will be on the call

 Dan Szente Chief Investment Officer
 Robert Aguallo Chief Operating Officer

 Barry Gonder Senior Investment Officer AIM
 Rick Hayes Senior Principal Investment Officer AIM primary Enron contact

 Mark Anson Senior Investment Officer Public Equities
 Mary Cottrill Senior Principal Investment Officer Public Equities

 Lou Jug Senior Principal Investment Officer Real Estate

 Curtis Ishi Senior Investment Officer Fixed Income

Bush answers How about a quickie

I think the letter is well organized to get our message across that a

at the end of the first paragraph to  the crisis grows daily with no clear
resolution offering long term relief in sight  In fact we do no have
several bills on demand side management one by Wright on accelerating
repowering of power plants and allowing incentives for voluntary
conservation at least a vehicle for utility cost recovery ABX and a
Bown bill to restore direct access rights compromised by ABX  So I am
concerned that the legislative leadership would take some umbrage at the
notion that we dont see any of what they are doing as offering hope for a
long term solution  Perhaps we could rephrase it to say that the piecemeal
elements of positive solutions that have been discussed or offered need to

be interested to learn whether Enron can purchase crude oil from this 
program provided that we receive proof that it comes out of the UN program

		 Subject Mexican Energy Secretary Martens meeting with Dr Lay

Rick

As you know last week I had a meeting with Fernando Alonso who is the head 
of Investment Promotion at the Mexican Department of Energy  We discussed 
the gas price policy electric deregulation and the role that Enron has been 
playing and can play in all these matters

I pointed to him that Presidents Bush and Fox were geting together on 
February th and that President Fox has been declaring to the media that he 
will talk about a common energy policy with President Bush  

We agreed that it would be useful for Secretary Martens to Meet with Dr Lay 
before the Presidents meet  Fernando Alonso admitted to me today that 
Secretary Martens wanted to hear Mr Lays opinion on this subject and perhaps 
recieve some advice with respect to talking points for President Fox with 
President Bush regarding energy policy

Secretary  Martens  teamand now the Secretary himself view Mr Lay as an 
ideal communication link between the Mexican and the US Governments for 
energy policy  This is the reason why the Secretary wants to meet with Mr 
Lay before the th  Originally they had agreed on meeting on Feb th at 
 am Nevertheless President Fox has asked that Secretary Martens to 
meet him in Mexico City on Monday the th which is why I got a call from 
Fernando Alonso asking if Mr Lay could see Secretary Martens on Sunday the 
th between  pm and  pm  

Secretary Martens has to be at a CERA dinner on Sunday at  pm

Fernando Alonso Dionisio PerezJacome Undersecretary Niceforo Guerrero and 
myself will be meeting tomorrow at  am to talk about electric 
deregulation  They are expecting an answer from me by then

Dionisio PerezJacome president of the CRE FERC equivalent is going to be 
in Houston on Monday the th  I would like you and Steve Kean to meet with 
him if you are going to be in town  I would also like to organize a tour for 
him that day  Well talk about this tomorrow night when I see you

Thanks for your support

Its alittle early to be talking about Phils birhtday but I have had some
conversations with him about replacing his PC with a more modern one that I
will build for him  I want to know if you want to go in with me Hell get
the PC in the near future but I dont expect anyone to contribute until his
birthday

Heres the way it would work we give Phil a new PC I send an old Compaq of
ours to Kathy and Alan Wedig Phil sends his old PC to some friends of mine
who live in Duluth MN  That means that our entire family will be
connected

If not I would send the Old Compaq to Phil otherwise and then he could send
his old one to Kathy and Alan  The only problem with this scenario is that
Phils old PC is getting a little too old  Our friends in Duluth wouldnt
mind getting an old PC because theyve never owned one  I thought that Phil
would benefit the most from getting a brand new PC  The old Compaq is will
still be okay for a while and Kathy should be fine with it

What do you guys think  If i do this right Kathy would have a PC for her
birhtday in March

I am looking at a proposal under which a Russian oilmajor would be wishing 
to sell Iraqui crude to us coming from the UN oilforfood program I would 
be interested to learn whether Enron can purchase crude oil from this 
program provided that we receive proof that it comes out of the UN program 
and whether we are willing to do it corporate policy

I want to check that out first before going forward Next step would be to 
receive a good level of confidence that the offer is genuine and then I 
would talk to the liquids traders

Mike lead a team that included legal credit accounting and tax to put 
together a standard electricity purchase and sale agreement for Japan which

		 Subject NCC Power Deal  First electricity transaction

Dear all

Enron Japan did today their first power transaction and the first power 
derivative transaction ever in Japan The counterpart is Nippon ChemiCon 
Kabushiki Kaisha NCC

The term of the deal is      with a yearly volume of around 
 MWh

The basic structure of the electricity transaction is that Enron Japan gives 
the counterpart a  discount on their actual electricity bill for the 
period      This discount or the option premium gives Enron the 
right but not the obligation to supply NCC with Electricity for the  yearly 
supply terms starting          and    at predefined prices 
If Enron Japan decide to supply NCC with Electricity for a specific supply 
term we need to inform them  months before the start of the supply term 
This structure give Enron Japan the necessary flexibility to operate in a 
newly deregulated electricity market

The deal was closed by Morten Erik Pettersen with very good support from 
Rousseau Anai Associate Power Trading and Jane McBride Senior Legal 
Counsel

		 Subject INVESTIGATION OF CORRUPTION IN THE TURKISH ENERGY SECTOR  PRIVATE 
 CONFIDENTIAL


	


Eric Shaws team has learned that an investigation has been initiated by the 
Turkish military to expose and eliminate corruption in the Turkish energy 
sector

On January  the military took seven energy sector bureaucrats into custody 
In the following days other officials from TEA the electricity generation 
monopoly and the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources MENR and 
executives from a number of Turkish companies were also taken into custody 

While many of the bureaucrats and executives have been released a leaked 
report from the military investigators suggests that the operation is wide 
ranging and may ultimately target the Minister of Energy and Natural 
Resources and other senior energy sector bureaucrats and businessmen 

Enron Implications

Trakya  One Turkish newspaper has reported that Enrons   MW Trakya power 
project was being investigated  This has not been reported anywhere else  
Because the power price at Trakya has been the target of criticism in the 
past we are not surprised by this report Although an investigation is 
always a possibility other than the one newspaper report there has been no 
indication official or otherwise that an investigation is planned or 
underway
 
GAMA  It has also been reported that the wife of Gorkhan Yardim the General 
Manager of BOTA the natural gas monopoly works at GAMA our Turkish 
partner in the Trakya project and that his expensive car was a gift from 
GAMA GAMA has told us and Yardim has defended himself publicly by saying 
that his wife has been working at GAMA since  long before Yardim had 
risen to his current position of power at BOTA and that the car was not a 
gift from GAMA It is worth noting however that there have been a number of 
newspaper reports questioning GAMAs role in a controversial gas marketing 
deal being undertaken by their TurRusGas joint venture with Gazprom and BOTA

Outlook

It is still not clear how or when this investigation will end In the medium 
and long term this will be good news for Enron and other reputable Turkish 
or foreign companies which have found it difficult to do transparent energy 
deals in Turkey in the past In the short term however it is likely to 
result in a marked decrease in meaningful activity in the Turkish energy

Subject New Economy Conference with Senate Democrats


Mr Skilling

The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee DSCC and Senators Daschle
Murray Wyden Leahy Bingaman Kerry Baucus Carnahan Durbin Dorgan and
Schumer are hosting a series of discussions on the future of the New Economy
in Beaver Creek Colorado on March    At this time we have about
 executives from venture capital communications and other high tech
businesses attending the conference  Most of those attendees joined the
DSCCs High Technology Council in 

The Council was created last year in order to create a bridge between
Democratic Senators and key leaders of the New Economy  Throughout  we
hosted dinners meetings and conferences that gave high tech leaders and
Senators the opportunity to engage in an ongoing dialogue on the key issues
facing the nation  As a result the Senators and participants in the
Council were able to develop a solid understanding of the challenges facing
both government and business  We hope that this effort has created a
foundation for strong longterm relationships between the two groups

The Conference in March is a continuation of last years efforts but we
will focus on a few of the key issues facing the New Economy to allow both
sides can drill down and gain a better understanding of some of the
opportunities and problems we will face in the near future

In order to attend you would need to become a member of the DSCCs High
Tech Council by donating  to the DSCC  That would make you eligible
to participate in a series of events conferences and meetings this year
with other industry leaders and Democratic Senators

I have attached an invitation to the event a registration form and
information on becoming a member of the Council  We have reserved only a
small number of rooms for new members of the DSCCs High Tech Council  If
you would like to attend please let me know as soon as possible and please
do not hesitate to contact me regarding any questions concerns or for more
information  I can have a firm agenda to you in the very near future but I
am waiting on some feedback from people like yourself regarding the issues
they would like to discuss  In your response please let me know if you
have any particular issues that are of concern to you

Thank you very much for your time and consideration

Sincerely

Chad FitzGerald
Director  DSCC High Technology Council

Steve

Thank you for agreeing to speak at the ETS HR Conference  Since we spoke 
last week the meeting date has changed from February  to Monday February 
 to better accomodate presentors and attendees schedules  We have 
confirmed that this date works well for both you and Stan Horton  On the 
th we will kick off the afternoon session with lunch at  PM followed 
by your presentation from  and Stans from   You are 
invited to have lunch with us and spend as much time with us that afternoon 
as your schedule allows

To follow up on our conversation last week it would be great if you could 
talk to the group about Enrons performance in  its successes and 
stumbles and how ENEs stock price is impacted  It would also be helpful if 
you could discuss the look of Enron in  what its primary busninesses are 
and how they drive earnings as well as what significant initiatives Enron 
has planned for   I have asked Stan to talk about ETS performance 
during  what he was pleased with and what lessons were learned  He also 
will share his perspective on how ETS fits into Enrons plans for  as 
well as what initiatives and objectives are critical to ETS success this 
year

Thanks again for taking time out of your schedule to spend it with the ETS HR 
team  I look forward to seeing you on February

The value of undies

Be careful what you wear or dont wear when working under your
vehicleespecially in public From the Sydney Morning Herald Australia
comes this story of a central west couple who drove their car to KMart
only to have their car break down in the parking lot

The man told his wife to carry on with the shopping while he fixed the car

there in the lot The wife returned later to see a small group of people
near the car

On closer inspection she saw a pair of male legs protruding from under
the chassis Although the man was in shorts his lack of underpants turned

private parts into glaringly public ones

Unable to stand the embarrassment she dutifully stepped forward quickly
put her hand UP his shorts and tucked everything back into place

On regaining her feet she looked across the hood and found herself
staring at her husband who was standing idly by

The mechanic however had to have three stitches in his head

of followup items

Thanks to the Portland and Washington teams Sen Wyden is very interested in 
identifying the kind of information we need from the ISO and PX to the 
extent its still relevant to make the market work better  We have written 
this up before I think we just need to put it in letter form  Alan  
please take the lead on this and get a draft to Linda  I think we should 
identify the information and also prepare a letter for the Chairman  that 
could be sent to the FERC
Murkowski the Committee Chairman asked for an itemized list of things the 
fed should do to expedite siting as well as anything else we feel is 
necessary  to address the California crisis  We have identified the need for 
open access across the nation but he is looking for what can be done in the 
 month time frame  Dave I think your memo to me is a good start  Sue  
could you please put those and any other suggestions in letter form and get 
them to Linda
Finally Sen Feinstein asked all of the witnesses to ask their CEOs not to 
price gouge  yes thats what she said  She appealed to everyones 
community spirit and asked suppliers to forbear charging high prices while 
California struggles to fix its problems  I think we should send a response 
from Ken  Jeff  please take a cut and get to Linda  I think the basic 
messages should be  we are actively working on solutions with California 
policymakers forward contracting was our idea after all we are actively 
pursuing demand reduction in the state etc  We should also explain the 
nature of our business and pick up on some of the other solutions we 
identified in the written testimony offer to meet to discuss further etc"
2001-01-31T09:35:00-08:00,"I spoke with Ken about the Business Council  He agreed errors of commission 
are much better than errors of omission  H e does want to be personally 
involved in the invitations from here on and he is very willing to make calls 
next week to help get some confirmations  Deal directly with him    
theres no need for me to be in the middle  Also a bit of background  
Greenspan is always invited to the reception the night before but they dont 
want to offer him a speaking spot because he wont speak without the press 
present  

Thanks again for all your work on the Senate hearing  I felt overprepared  
which is just how I want to feel  and every bit of information I needed was

 A  Moment
 Al Gores selection of Joe Lieberman gives Democratsand everyone
 elsesomething to cheer about
 BY PEGGY NOONAN
 Monday August    pm EDT
 The choice of Joe Lieberman of Connecticut as Al Gores running mate is so
 smart so clever so good so satisfying so striking that it just may
 turn
 this election a bit on its head for a while Certainly its most immediate
 effect is going to be a successful Democratic convention next week in Los
 Angeles because now the Democrats badly hit by their own form of Clinton
 fatigue and acutely aware of the particular charmlessness of their
 presidential candidate have something to cheer about They respect Joe
 Lieberman They think he has a center a moral and ethical view of the
 world He is experienced and articulate He is decent and intelligent He
 is
 independent The media love him He is a regular costar on Imus and all
 of
 the columnists and reporters for the elite newspapers and all of the
 electronic pundits and anchors know him and admire him
 But that is not what is most wonderful What is most wonderful is that he
 is
 an Orthodox Jew What does this mean It means a lot of people who love
 America more than they love parties or politics are happy that a big and
 great breakthrough has occurred A friend a journalist who is politically
 conservative and Jewish emailed me to tell me he had been weeping all
 morning that hed cried when he heard the news Another friend a
 producer at a TV news show called and told me she woke her father in
 California to give him the news and they both got choked up This is like
  she said and I said I know and I got choked up It is wonderful
 when America is at her most American and breaks down another barrier and
 says Whats in your heart is most important
 If Joe Lieberman had been Joe Lee and an Episcopalian Al Gore would have
 been smart to pick him He would have been an obvious choice The only
 reason he would have hesitated over Mr Lieberman is that hes Jewish Mr
 Gore decided that was just fine I think that I have never seen Al Gore do
 such an elegant intelligent and original thing Well done Mr Gore
 I have to tell you this really does feel like a  moment to me I was
 a
 little girl when a Catholic got chosen to run for president and I had
 gathered from the conversation of grownups that You Dont Elect Catholics
 to the Presidency When it happened its hard to describe how exciting
 and
 moving and idealisminspiring it was It gave a lot of people a lot of
 joy
 It opened things up more That was a good thing So is this
 And because this is such a good thing I hope everyone of whatever
 politics
 or persuasion sits back for a few days and feels good about it Everyone
 should be nice and not do any political bashing until    Friday
 However I think its okay and maybe even helpful to note the following
 Network producers are going to decide in their bright and touchingly
 uninformed minds that the big opponents of the Lieberman choice will be
 Christian conservatives Thats where theyll go for the negative sound
 bites But Christian conservatives love Joe Lieberman Theyve been arm in
 arm with him in the great cultural battles of the past decade He was just
 about the only Democrat whod give them the time of day He was on their
 side
 The last time I saw Mr Lieberman was last spring in New York at a
 symposium on Hollywood and the culture I moderated and introduced our
 guestsJoe Lieberman and Bill Bennett who are close friends and
 cowarriors in the values battle Lieberman and Bennett very frankly
 talked
 to the audience of producers and writers and network people and movie
 stars about how to make television and film and music more decent more
 helpful
 This is how people on the right think of and have experienced Mr
 Liebermanas a good guy with his head screwed on right
 Many conservative ChristiansI think most conservative Christianssee
 all
 of those who love God as part of the same cultural minority
 Conservative
 Christians dont feel they have much in common in terms of their
 political
 desires with atheists and agnostics and leftist Episcopalian bishops and
 such But they think they have a great deal in common with Orthodox Jews
 They crowd around Rabbi Daniel Lapin when he speaks at a conservative
 gathering they crowd around Dennis Prager Michael Medved David Horowitz
 and scores of others One of the biggest heroes of conservative Christians
 is an Orthodox Jew called Dr Laura the last time I saw her she was
 wowing them at a bornagain Christian assembly at the National Prayer
 Breakfast last February
 A powerful and respected political officeholder told me Monday that
 theres
 no upside to the Lieberman choice I told him theres no downside He
 was surprised and said He cant even campaign on Saturdays I said so
 what America would love to see a politician who actually put God first
 one day a week
 I wish Id added this Remember Sandy Koufax Joe Lieberman not
 campaigning on Saturday is Sandy Koufax not pitching on Yom Kippur There
 were a lot of great sports moments in the s and s but none
 greater than the day in  when Mr Koufax put God before the World
 Series What a great guy what a lesson for a generation of Christian and
 Jewish kids And Muslims and everyone else too
 Yes its good news for Hillary Its great news for Hillary It enlivens
 part of her New York base it says to New York Jews that the Democrats are
 the party that did this great thing it excites peopleand may help them
 forget or at least not remember so vividly that the Democratic
 senatorial
 candidate has shall we say a not fully satisfying relationship with New
 Yorks Jews A historic choice like the Mr Lieberman can overwhelm a lot
 of
 previous bad static
 But lets not care about that for now The headline is not Is It Good for
 Hillary The headline is It Is Good for America It is a wonderful
 country that does something like this that takes a good man who is a
 member of a small ethnic religious minority to be one of its two major
 vice
 presidential candidates and that greets that choice with resounding
 hurrahs
 This is really a great day We should all be happy We really are a
 maturing
 democracy"

Subject RE Eurelectric Congress Madrid June


Dear Peter

We are very happy with your suggestion and we would like to propose that the
presentation also includes the interactions between power and gas trading
and access to networks since the conference is about the convergence of
these two sectors

We would be very greatful if you could identify the speaker and the title of
the presentation during the following days so that this can be included in
the programme as soon as possible and go for final printing

What do you think about a title like Trading of gas and electricity and
access to networks  what does the California experience learn us

Best regards and thank you agan

Ana

Reverting to you after some delay Ana I confirm our willingness to
provide a senior speaker We may be able to secure a Houstonbased
corporate executive level Managing Director if you can give us the latitude
to introduce the subject of experiences in California and lessons for the
European power markets This would still be a trading and wholesale
perspective and indeed the lessons relate partly to issues of power
imports and exports across state boundaries What do you think
Regards
          Peter

 A  Moment
 Al Gores selection of Joe Lieberman gives Democratsand everyone
 elsesomething to cheer about
 BY PEGGY NOONAN
 Monday August    pm EDT
 The choice of Joe Lieberman of Connecticut as Al Gores running mate is so
 smart so clever so good so satisfying so striking that it just may
 turn
 this election a bit on its head for a while Certainly its most immediate
 effect is going to be a successful Democratic convention next week in Los
 Angeles because now the Democrats badly hit by their own form of Clinton
 fatigue and acutely aware of the particular charmlessness of their
 presidential candidate have something to cheer about They respect Joe
 Lieberman They think he has a center a moral and ethical view of the
 world He is experienced and articulate He is decent and intelligent He
 is
 independent The media love him He is a regular costar on Imus and all
 of
 the columnists and reporters for the elite newspapers and all of the
 electronic pundits and anchors know him and admire him
 But that is not what is most wonderful What is most wonderful is that he
 is
 an Orthodox Jew What does this mean It means a lot of people who love
 America more than they love parties or politics are happy that a big and
 great breakthrough has occurred A friend a journalist who is politically
 conservative and Jewish emailed me to tell me he had been weeping all
 morning that hed cried when he heard the news Another friend a
 producer at a TV news show called and told me she woke her father in
 California to give him the news and they both got choked up This is like
  she said and I said I know and I got choked up It is wonderful
 when America is at her most American and breaks down another barrier and
 says Whats in your heart is most important
 If Joe Lieberman had been Joe Lee and an Episcopalian Al Gore would have
 been smart to pick him He would have been an obvious choice The only
 reason he would have hesitated over Mr Lieberman is that hes Jewish Mr
 Gore decided that was just fine I think that I have never seen Al Gore do
 such an elegant intelligent and original thing Well done Mr Gore
 I have to tell you this really does feel like a  moment to me I was
 a
 little girl when a Catholic got chosen to run for president and I had
 gathered from the conversation of grownups that You Dont Elect Catholics
 to the Presidency When it happened its hard to describe how exciting
 and
 moving and idealisminspiring it was It gave a lot of people a lot of
 joy
 It opened things up more That was a good thing So is this
 And because this is such a good thing I hope everyone of whatever
 politics
 or persuasion sits back for a few days and feels good about it Everyone
 should be nice and not do any political bashing until    Friday
 However I think its okay and maybe even helpful to note the following
 Network producers are going to decide in their bright and touchingly
 uninformed minds that the big opponents of the Lieberman choice will be
 Christian conservatives Thats where theyll go for the negative sound
 bites But Christian conservatives love Joe Lieberman Theyve been arm in
 arm with him in the great cultural battles of the past decade He was just
 about the only Democrat whod give them the time of day He was on their
 side
 The last time I saw Mr Lieberman was last spring in New York at a
 symposium on Hollywood and the culture I moderated and introduced our
 guestsJoe Lieberman and Bill Bennett who are close friends and
 cowarriors in the values battle Lieberman and Bennett very frankly
 talked
 to the audience of producers and writers and network people and movie
 stars about how to make television and film and music more decent more
 helpful
 This is how people on the right think of and have experienced Mr
 Liebermanas a good guy with his head screwed on right
 Many conservative ChristiansI think most conservative Christianssee
 all
 of those who love God as part of the same cultural minority
 Conservative
 Christians dont feel they have much in common in terms of their
 political
 desires with atheists and agnostics and leftist Episcopalian bishops and
 such But they think they have a great deal in common with Orthodox Jews
 They crowd around Rabbi Daniel Lapin when he speaks at a conservative
 gathering they crowd around Dennis Prager Michael Medved David Horowitz
 and scores of others One of the biggest heroes of conservative Christians
 is an Orthodox Jew called Dr Laura the last time I saw her she was
 wowing them at a bornagain Christian assembly at the National Prayer
 Breakfast last February
 A powerful and respected political officeholder told me Monday that
 theres
 no upside to the Lieberman choice I told him theres no downside He
 was surprised and said He cant even campaign on Saturdays I said so
 what America would love to see a politician who actually put God first
 one day a week
 I wish Id added this Remember Sandy Koufax Joe Lieberman not
 campaigning on Saturday is Sandy Koufax not pitching on Yom Kippur There
 were a lot of great sports moments in the s and s but none
 greater than the day in  when Mr Koufax put God before the World
 Series What a great guy what a lesson for a generation of Christian and
 Jewish kids And Muslims and everyone else too
 Yes its good news for Hillary Its great news for Hillary It enlivens
 part of her New York base it says to New York Jews that the Democrats are
 the party that did this great thing it excites peopleand may help them
 forget or at least not remember so vividly that the Democratic
 senatorial
 candidate has shall we say a not fully satisfying relationship with New
 Yorks Jews A historic choice like the Mr Lieberman can overwhelm a lot
 of
 previous bad static
 But lets not care about that for now The headline is not Is It Good for
 Hillary The headline is It Is Good for America It is a wonderful
 country that does something like this that takes a good man who is a
 member of a small ethnic religious minority to be one of its two major
 vice
 presidential candidates and that greets that choice with resounding
 hurrahs
 This is really a great day We should all be happy We really are a
 maturing
 democracy"

		 Subject Washington Actions re Dabhol

Steve
 With regard to Dabhol Tom Briggs and I have already provided a status 
briefing on the Dabhol situation to agencies across the government  
including DoEnergy DOCommerceDOState and DOTreasury  The briefing was with 
staff and brought them up to speed on where we stand   As the new 
administration moves into the positions relevant to the situation we will 
brief them  all the way up to the cabinet officals  I understand that Colin 
Powell has already been briefed on the situation  and I know the Ambasssador 
has been front and center on the issue
 If we were to move into a crisis mode we will need to brief senior officals 
of the new administration at each of the  above agencies as well as the VPs 
office  Given their interest I think we will be able to do that quickly
 We have also briefed OPIC and EXIM about the situation  they are 
comfortable at this point
 I am also getting the World Bank reengaged to the extent that it is helpful 
and not a problem  They have resources that can help MSEB reform themselves 
if MSEB will view it has a help  It is a sensitive issue because the Bank 
has historically been antiDabhol so I am taking it step by step
 If you have any other questions just let me know  thanks John

JimI had a wide ranging social business conversation with Curt Hebert on 
Saturday night at one of the inaugural events  Ill call you to give you the 
details including all the good things I said about you  He was being 
quite negative about the WGA Feb  meeting in Portland basically saying that 
his predecessor had committed to some positions that he was not in agreement 
with and that he didnt think he wanted to participate  I promised him that 
either you or I would call him after our Governor meetings this week to give 
him our sense of where the positions players were going to shake out  My 
initial thought was that we would want him there as a good voice on our side 
but my second thought is that there might be a better strategy play not 
having FERC there  As you saw by the e mail exchange last week between 
Cynthia Sandherr and me the democrat senators Murray and Cantwell are also 
following this meeting although I dont know if they are participating

Ill call you tomorrow and fill you in on the conversation

LindaI also made a small commitment on tobacco issues that Ill need to

Dear Mr Steve Kean
 It was such a pleasure having chance do an interview last week I have a few 
follow up questions
According to todays Wall Street Journal Mr Jeffrey Skilling president 
and chief executiveelect of Enron is saying the company could sell some 
power to PGE and SoCal at  cents per kilowatt hour Am I understanding 
your position right Is it going to be something like a  year contract Will 
it help your business at all
California Power Exchange has decided to cease its operation by the end of 
April Do you think this is the right decision How do you think you can set 
up a new competitive market Or wont you need such a market Will it be 
better to use the markets outside Califorinia or to rely on direct trading
How much supply do you have in excess from which you can offer power to 
California


I understand you are very busy but I would really appreciate if you could 
send me a reply at your earliest convenience
Thank you very much

2001-01-21T08:24:00-08:00,"I think there is merit in pursuing this  A couple of comments
It may be unduly complicated to get customers to provide the funding  
Perhaps we should focus on the banks instead  The deal might be further 
funding in exchange for legislative and regulatory concessions on rates 
transmission and generation siting and the rest of the items you outline
Rubin would be great to have but having watched Summers in action Im not 
sure we need another extreas  Summers is superb uptospeed and 
apparently willing to work on this  Linda  how would Larry feel if we 
brought in his exboss I know theyre buddies but does Summers really need 
the help
Need to keep an eye on the ball for large customers many of whom are ours  
they will continue to need some access to better rates  Perhaps the proposal 
could be converted to cash in exchange for demand reductions

Crisis

Dean Tyson

It was a pleasure to see you again today Phil it was a pleasure to meet you 
and I look forward to working together  Since time is of the essence I 
wanted to summarize where we left off at todays meeting regarding California
s energy crisis  That summary is attached  Ive also attached three 
articles from the business section of todays Chronicle that arguably bolster 
our arguments for adopting the approach that we discussed at todays meeting

 Given the fact that the legislative process is moving rapidly bankruptcy is 
a daily threat and Dean Tyson will be attending the meetings in Davos it 
appears that our window of opportunity is very small  It seems that success 
requires a meeting of the principals by the end of the week if not sooner  
The chances of success are obviously limited but I think that we agreed that 
all concerned have nothing to lose and everything to gain by taking a shot 
Your offer to help in the effort obviously increases the likelihood of 
success and is greatly appreciated  

My apologies in advance if I have mischaracterized any of the points made at 
the meeting  It represents a first cut it will undoubtedly change as the 
details get worked out and Im sure Ive missed something  So please dont 
hesitate to edit the draft

Please keep in mind that I have not had a chance to discuss this proposal 
internally  As such I cant yet commit Enron to the specifics of the 
proposal  But Im confident that the company can support something akin to 
this structure and can let you and Phil know first thing Monday

In addition given the political environment in California Enron has played 
a constructive role by providing lowkey behind the scenes advice and 
analysis to policy makers  That approach seems preferable in this effort as 
well

Finally Dean Tyson I mentioned that Linda Robertson headsup our Washington 
DC office  If she can help in any way please dont hesitate to let me 
know  Both of you should feel free to call me at home over the weekend to 
discuss things further  My home phone is 

Best
Jeff

Title High Speed Regulation in California
URL http  wwwceracom eprofileum


A Feverish Pitch
The pace of regulatory and political events in California has taken on the
feverish pitch of the energy market crisis itself Important decisions
regarding a wide range of market structure issues are being made quickly at 
the
California Public Utilities Commission CPUC and the state Legislature
increasing the level of uncertainty most market participants already perceive
in the quickly evolving California market Sudden changes are being made to 
the
market structure changes that used to require years in Californias complex
regulatory and legislative proceedings

As rolling blackouts have rippled through urban centers of Northern California
on January  and  including in portions of downtown San Francisco
Sacramento and the Silicon Valley state officials are scrambling to set up
the appropriate credit mechanisms to ensure the continued delivery of scarce
western energy supplies to Californias two largest utilities Even at prices
near  per megawatthour MWh the California Department of Water 
Resources
CDWR attempting to buy power on behalf of Pacific Gas and Electric PGE
and Southern California Edison SCE has been unable to secure enough to keep
the lights on In the mean time legal actions by some energy suppliers
threaten to tip the utilities into bankruptcyand are being held at bay only 
by
direct intervention of Californias governor

Below is a summary of the various state actions being pursued concurrently

California governor California Governor Gray Davis continues to attempt to
act on behalf of PGE and SCE to secure longterm contracts for supply from
merchant generation owners and marketers in California On the same front the
governor has been negotiating with generators in an attempt to keep them from
seeking compensation through the courts for energy delivered to the utilities
Courtordered reimbursement could prompt bankruptcy

Legislature Bills have been approved to authorize continued power purchases
on behalf of PGE and SCE by the CDWR to restructure the independent system
operators ISO governing board to consist of five members appointed by the
governor to restrict the ability of the ISO to enter into a broader 
interstate
regional transmission organization RTO without the explicit approval of
Californias Electricity Oversight Board and to prohibit the divestiture of
the investorowned utilities remaining generating assets until  The
vehicle for pursuing authorization of state bond financing for acquisition of
transmission assets and construction of new generation facilities is still
being developed

California Public Utilities Commission On January  the CPUC adopted a
decision prohibiting the sale of SCEs Mohave Generating Station to AES This
voids a sale that was announced but not closed The CPUC also delayed 
decisions
regarding SCEs application to end its rate freeze and the prudency criteria
for utilities entering into longterm supply contracts

Some of these issues will continue to evolve as they progress along their
respective and sometimes intersecting paths and some will need to pass 
through
multiple review bodies This rapid and erratic evolution has not helped to
decrease either the financial risk associated with supplying energy to
Californias two largest utilities or the level of uncertainty in developing
new generation to supply California in the future

The ISO anticipates that it will call stage  emergencies reserves less than
 percent for January  and will most likely continue to curtail
interruptible customers through the weekend Western energy supplies are being
strained by recent heavy usage of hydroelectric facilities where water 
supplies
are already as much as  percent below average owing to low precipitation 
and
continued plant outages near  MW in California The gravity of the
financial condition of Californias two largest utilities is exemplified by 
the
need for other more creditworthy intermediaries including California
municipal utilities state agencies and some unregulated energy suppliers to
act as temporary  guarantors for the acquisition of energy on behalf of PGE
and SCE

		 Subject Analyst Meeting Talking Points

Here are some thoughts for Enron to share with at the Analyst meeting  
Please let me know if you have any additions changes or deletions  What I 
tried to put down were the key facts and positions  If Ive missed anything 
let me know  This is not a great story

Jim

OUR PHYSICAL POSITION IN CALIFORNIA

EES has electricity customers within the territories of SCE PGE and SDGE 
about  MW of usage NOTE  CHECK WITH EES  EES has natural gas 
customers within the territories PGE and SoCal Gas

Enron does not have any generation in California we own a small QF in Nevada 
but only have  MW excess  

We supply power to the Utilities and to our retail load by buying excess in 
California or by transmitting power into the state  Enron sells natural gas 
to the LDCs mainly under spot arrangements

Enron continues to manage the risk by using traditional hedging tools and by 
using the full complement of resources of EES  demand reduction load 
shaping and efficiency improvements

Transwestern has longterm capacity arrangements with PGE

OUR POLITICAL POSITION IN CALIFORNIA   MESSAGES

The current situation shortages and potential bankruptcy is not the result 
of competitive markets rather it is the result of barriers to workable 
retail and wholesale markets designed into the California deregulation model 
for instance the overreliance of the Utilities on the spot market the 
residual CTC calculation incomplete retail tariff unbundling requiring 
direct access customers to pay more than their fair share for the Utilities 
common costs 

Enron does not want to see the California Utilities go bankrupt because those 
naysayers of competition will use this situation as an argument against 
competition  Enron disagrees  What it proves is that not finishing the job 
of creating real competition can result in problems  

Enron believes that there are workable shortterm and longterm solutions for 
California

In the shortterm  California must provide credit enhancement or directly 
buy power for the Utilities needs to ensure a stable supply of electricity 
 California should incent customers to institute demand reductions and 
 California should raise rates to cover reasonable costs so that the 
Utilities do not petition for bankruptcy

In the longterm  California needs to continue its activities to promote 
retail competition and most importantly it must allow real price signals to 
be sent to large customers  California should implement the changes that 
the FERC highlighted end the reliance on the spot market remove 
stakeholders on the Cal ISO Board give the Utilties the ability to recover 
wholesale power costs  California must remove unnecessary barriers to 
the development of additional generation capacity and most importantly  
California must establish reasonable structures so that the Utilities develop 
a balanced portfolio of supplies to better manage electricity market 
volatility

California should not get into the business of owning or operating generation 
assets or transmission facilities  

California should not stop moving forward with retail competitition which 
allows customers to manage price risk rather than some regulator

KEY ENRON ISSUES IN CALIFORNIA

We do have outstanding deliveries into the California utilities and would be 
an unsecured creditor if bankruptcy occurs We continue to sell to 
creditworthy counterparties in Western Power markets NOTE  THE AMOUNT OF 
RISK IS AN IR ISSUE THEY WANT TO MANAGE

The PX Credit and associated negative CTC continues to be an issue  Enron 
believes that the rate freeze has not yet ended legally and PGEs and SCEs 
tariff requires the Utilities to pay funds to the customers agent  We filed 
a Complaint Friday January  at the CPUC  We are confident that these funds 
will be recovered  NOTE  I DONT THINK WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THIS  AGAIN 
AN IR ISSUE BECAUSE OF THE RECEIVABLE

		 Subject Ken Lays DC Schedule

I would like to explore how the DC Office can plug in on the advance planning 
of Kens DC trips  As we get things organized here I want to do a better job 
of maximizing the use of our corporate execs when they are in town  This is 
hard to do without some advance notice of travel arrangements  I do not want 
to be intrusive but I do think we can bring added value to Enrons presence 
in DC  What most immediately brings this to mind is that I learned from news 
sources today that Ken is giving a speech participating via panel at the 
Club for Growths event tomorrow morning at  am in Senate Dirksen   We 
have been busily planning all of Enron executives trips to the inaugural and 
I thought I had something of a handle on each executives itinerary  So this 
came as a surprise  A second  problem with this is that it is being hosted 
by Craig Shirley Associates  I am told by Cynthia that Craig Shirley Assoc 
is the group that last year hired private investigators to ferret out our 
tactics and strategies on electric restructuring  Ken may not know this 
relationship  Some vetting of the invite might have brought this to his 
attention  I appreciate your thoughts on this and how I can most effectively 
add our input  Thanks

		 Subject Request for Economist

Steve Kean asked that I respond to your voice mail message to him regarding 
your solicitation of government economists for your proposed May customer 
conference  Let me suggest the following each of whom has different 
attributes

  David Wilcox Asst Sec of Economic Policy of Treasury soon to rejoin 
the Federal Reserve   David is an excellent macro economist but is not a 
big name
  Ted Truman Asst Sec of International Affairs Treasury  Ted is about 
join a think tank  Before his stint at Treasury Ted served  years at the 
Federal Reserve many of which he served as Greenspans right hand on 
international currency issues  Ted has quarterbacked about every 
international currency intervention conducted by the United States over the 
last three decades  
  Larry Summers Secretary   Larry will be joining a think tank for a few 
weeks  He may or may not be available  If the topic is of interest to him 
he is agreeable to travel and speaking engagements  
 
This is just my initial cut at some suggestions  Once we know the Bush team 
we may want to explore possible candidates from their ranks although 
government ethics rules may prohibit us from paying for their travel to a 
customer conference  Government officials can accept travel from 
lcs as a general rule"

		 Subject Final Status Report of EBS East Asia Regulatory Matters

 As many of you know I am going to be leaving Enron to pursue new 
opportunities  
  I am leaving with regret  as I have enjoyed working with all of you and I 
believe EBS
  is poised for great success in Asia   To assist in a smooth transition  I 
have prepared 
  this report on  the status of all EBS East Asia regulatory affairs actions 
I am working on 
  and my thoughts about next steps    A list of key contacts is also 
provided    Mark 
  Schroeder will reassign pending actions   

   Again many many thanks for your support and encouragement and for what I 
have 
   learned about broadband and EBS from each of you 

   Singapore

 a  SBO License Application   

        The application was completed in draft in December   Dan Arzola of 
EBS Asia 
        has a copy in Houston   We cannot proceed further on the application 
until we 
        decide what  legal entity to use   We have a legal entity Enron 
Broadband 
        Services Pte Ltd set up that encompasses all EBS activities 
including bandwidth t
        trading   

        The legal entity that we use in the application will have to pay a  
annual gross
        turnover fee unless we get it waived by the regulator on the grounds 
that the 
        turnover fee was never intended to capture bandwidth trading 
revenue   This 
        is a possible option in my opinion as the regulator IDA does not 
want to be working at cross
        purposes with other parts of the government that wish to provide EBS 
with incentives  
        See below
     
    b  Legal Due Diligence
   
        However before pursuing a waiver from IDA  we were planning to 
complete legal due 
        diligence to examine any options for avoiding the fee without a 
waiver   
        Donald is of the view see his Jan  email  that bandwidth trading 
has to be
        licensed by the regulator   In Europe bandwidth trading usually 
does not 
        require telecom licensing   If Donald is correct as he probably is 
there may be 
        less need of further legal research  on that point unless perhaps to 
confirm absolutely 
        that there is no way to shield EBS bandwidth trading from the 
turnover fee apart from
        a waiver or reduction of the fee    For example it is possible  that 
Jan Haizmann 
        or others may figure out a way to have actual trades escape the fee 
done offshore 
        for example   Jan I believe has some ideas on this that he adanced 
in the context
        of Korea  

        I believe it would still be prudent  to proceed as we had planned to 
engage
        a law firm here in Singapore as we have in Hong Kong and Japan for 
the purpose 
        of guiding us through these sorts of questions or at least 
confirming our reading
        and answering the many other questions posed in a matrix developed by 
a working 
        group headed by Wayne Gardner   We will likely be needing the firm 
anyway at 
        some point  
        
        I have prepared a list of seven law firms engaged in telecoms 
practice in Singapore
        EBS General Counsel is planning to examine its Asia strategy and whom 
to send and
        when to engage a firm to complete Waynes questionnaire and for other 
purposes

         My advice is after the due diligence is completed or we have at 
least confirmed
         that bandwidth trading is required to be in the licensed entity  
probably to go to the IDA and 
         discuss the implications of the fee for us   The contacts I would 
suggest discussing this
         with are Andy Haire and Fiona Yeo see contact list      IDA does 
not wish to prevent 
         EBSs coming to Singapore and the fee was of course set up without 
bandwidth trading
         specifically in mind as a revenue source   Bandwidth trading was 
referenced in the
         Code only later as a result of Enrons comment letters

  c  Arthur D Little consultant proposal to support EBS Pioneer Status 
Application

         This k proposal is now with us in final form after undergoing 
changes by me
         and two by our Houston tax lawyers   I was to have gone to ADL 
Singapore next
         for a meeting to question them on how much of this they are able to 
         do independently without reliance on us   This was a suggestion 
made by
         Jim Ginty of EBS tax to make sure they would not be reprocessing our 
info    
         I also intended to get them to pinpoint which of the products would 
be quantified
         rather than a where appropriate     Assuming we proceed with this 
proposal 
         someone else will need to do this conversation with ADL Singapore   

         I have forwarded the final proposal to Wayne Garder and Mark and 
most other
         interested parties earlier this week

        NB   Someone needs to be appointed to contact Simon MacCormac at ADL 
and explain
        at least our timing and process for getting back to him as a 
courtesy   I have not 
        replied to his final submission as of now   See contact info at end 
of email

         For background  the reason I believe EBS needs this work and sought 
a consultant
         proposal is that Pioneer Status is typically awarded  to companies 
that make major
         dollar infrastructure and jobcreation expenditures in 
Singapore   Our business
         model does just the opposite   So to be awarded Pioneer Status 
which the EDB is
         very willing to consider us for after many months of persuasion  I 
believe we need to  
         help EDB demonstrate what the quantitative spinoff benefits are for 
Singapore from our
         developing bandwidth trading here eg increased efficiencies of 
capacity utilization
         effect of lower bandwidth prices on attracting investment   This 
is a job for a  development 
         economist teamed with someone who knows about bandwidth trading   
To my mind
         if ADL cannot produce the bandwidth trading specialist we want it 
might be worth it 
         to have one of our experts assigned to liaise with  them and adjust 
the contract
         accordingly to reflect what part we are providing         

         One thing the ADL scope of work does not provide for is the actual 
completion of
         the Pioneer Status Application  only the supporting economic 
analysis  That is because it is
         proper for us to be the ones outlining our business plan for 
Singapore rather than
         running that information through ADL and charging its overhead  The 
idea is to get
         ADL to perform the quantitative economic development analysis we 
cannot do inhouse  

    d   Direct contact with EDB on EBSs plans

         EDB Chelsia Lim  has this week asked EBS to update her on its 
business
         plans for Singapore    I have made sure Craig Clark will take the 
responsibility
         for seeing this is handled   While a courtesy call is fine I would 
advise 
         not to brief her formally until EBS has really decided what our 
plans are
         with staffing etc   They have been asking for our plans for a 
while and
         are waiting for some specifics when we have them


    Hong Kong

        We have   licenses   IVANS value added services and ETS external
        telecoms services includes bandwidth trading

        There are several documents in draft and clearance which need to be 
filed
        under these licenses before we are able to operate in Hong Kong  
        The principal ones are a  the system configuration plan   b the 
tariff for
        sale and trading of circuits under the ETS license c the tariff for 
Mediacast 
        services under the IVANS license and later d a tariff for 
VOD EOD to
        be filed under the IVANS license

        a  status of system configuration plan

        The plan is done in draft and is being held pending a decision to be
         communicated by Roger Estrada within the next week or two as to 
whether 
         the Lucent G equipment described in the plan will be changed to 
other 
         equipment    The HK lawyers  Michelle Chan of Clifford Chance  
have said 
         that if we plan to provide other equipment at the outset we ought 
to just
         wait and send in the correct description rather than revise   If we 
do stick with
         the Lucent equipment  we will also need to revise our orginal 
license 
         application as well says Michelle Chan  to include description of 
related
         Cisco equipment that was not mentioned in our orginal license 
application

         When the system configuration plan is done in final we also need to 
         change the listed destination in the diagram from San Jose  to 
West Coast
         USA  Japan Singapore and Australia

         There are two copies of the present draft submission typed on the 
OFTA forms 
          I have given one to Craig Clark of EBS to carry back to Houston  
The other
         copy is with Annie Ng in our Singapore office

         When we know what equipment we are going to be using Tom Wei needs 
to
         revise the diagram and also make the changes in destination referred 
to above
         Other small edits need to be made in Appendix A see Dec  email 
referenced
         below   My successor should review the whole package once more 
with Michelle
         Chan in final    Then the final package needs to be cleared by 
Anthony Duenner
         and our EBS lawyers before going to Ken Rice or another qualified 
Director of
         our Hong Kong company for signature   After that it goes back to 
Michelle Chan
         for filing with OFTA

         NB   See Michelle Chans email of Dec  being repeated 
separately for 
                  further information  

       b   Tariffs for BWTrading under ETS License 

        In December in Houston I worked with Bill White and his staff on a 
tariff plan for
        bandwidth trading in HK   Based on a meeting I had with the 
regulator in Hong 
        Kong   we agreed to file pro forma ceiling prices rather than an 
entirely new
        and variable system which the regulator insisted we not do   
Ceiling  prices 
        were developed and submitted to Michelle Chan for review   

        Along with the prices we are required to submit our Terms and 
Conditions   For 
        that I used EBS General Terms and Conditions GTCs for trading 
obtained from 
        Robbi Rossi and Michelle Heard  Mike Grimes  has a set as well   

        Present status  Right now a dialogue is under way between Michelle 
Chan and  
        Robbi Rossi as to whether it is sufficient to file the GTCs alone or 
whether 
        certain exhibits service level agreements and confirmations 
referred to in
        the GTCs must also be filed   There are other questions being 
discussed in
        that channel  such as how to handle variations in the terms based on
        commercial dynamics     All these emails will be  forwarded   Once 
these
        issues related to the GTCs are resolved the tariff for bandwidth 
trading should
        be filed going through Michelle Chan

        NB  See Michelle Chan email of    which being forwarded 
separately


     c  Tariff for Media Cast under IVANS license

       I worked with Leroy Ho and Ken Wang in December and we submitted the 
main
       part of the Media Cast tariff to Michelle Chan   However we still 
need to get the
       Terms and Conditions for Media Cast from Robbi Rossi or Michelle Heard 
and
       attach them to the tariff diagrams and submit them to Michelle Chan 
       
       NB   See my email to Michelle Chan of Dec  which being repeated
       Someone needs to work with EBS legal to get the T and Cs for Media 
Cast to Michelle
       or to set up direct channel between EBS legal and Michelle Chan as in
       the case of the exchanges on the T and Cs for Bandwidth trading 
referred
       to above

      d   Overall change of responsibility for EBS Regulatory HK 

        Michael  or whomever will be taking over these responsibilities 
should 
        get from Michelle Chan of Clifford Chance Hong Kong a fresh copy of 
        Alison Lindsays letter to Xi Xi of October  stating that we 
received 
        our licenses and setting forth in detail all of the requirements   
This is the 
        master document bible on compliance under our licenses and will 
catch any
        detail not included above   For example

             my successor should also file a new form with OFTA  the Hong 
Kong 
              regulator form is included in the attachments to the letter  
naming 
              himself the point of contact replacing me    Michelle Chan 
can forward
              the letter to the regulator

             we will need to be selecting an independent auditor to certify 
certain routine
              reports we may need to file in future   I have not started on 
that


    Korea

       Robbi Rossi needs to call Kim and Chang law firm we use in Korea
       to authorize them to research and provide advice to us on how to 
handle 
       the apparent regulatory impediment to Bandwidth Trading in Korea that
       we identified during my November trip

       Once Kim and Chang starts work on this someone from regulatory should
       be made available to help guide Kim and Chang on our regulatory 
       questions in coordination with Robbi Rossi

       The key emails are a one from me outlining the overall problem and
        some suggestions for dealing with it   b one from Jan Haizmann 
with 
        some additional and in some cases alternative suggestions on how
        to deal with it  c  two from Jae Moo Lee in Korea with additional
        points of view  These will be forwarded  


     Japan  

       Our regulatory consultant is Art Yanagawa   Contact info below  Mike 
Grimes 
       and I have been in meetings with him and  Mike is fully briefed to 
carry on the 
       ontheground  part of contacts with Art   Art also responds to 
Donald and 
       Roger Estrada and relies on them for guidance and input     

      At some point it should be thought through who should be the point 
person
      to manage  this contract and approve payments or decide to leave things
      as they are with approvals done in Houston    The present system works 
but
      it is not clear to me who is responsible for what  

      Art has prepared the amendment to our Special Type   license to add
      service to other destinations   The latest status was that he was 
holding
      the amendment over the holidays while clarifying some points raised by
      Mike Grimes    Someone needs to be assigned responsibility for
      getting the amendment through  

      General Concern      

      A more general regulatory concern for us in Japan is that our 
consultant 
      advises us that we cannot use the term bandwidth trading  in 
      communications with the government because it is not something 
      contemplated in the Telecom Business Law  so is prohibited if 
      stated as we would state it elsewhere   

      We therefore are having to go through elaborate contortions to make 
      what we are planning to do actually look like we are doing something
      else    I admit that I agree with the approach we are taking for now 
and 
      can offer nothing better for the immediate term    

      However I would say that long term we are running some risks    If we 
      are going to make Japan  one of the centerpieces of our  Asia EBS 
      strategy   I think we need to consider devoting more full time EBS 
      regulatory resources to Japan exclusively    

       The allocation problem is that whatever regulatory resources we apply 
       have to focus on  immediate license amendment  and operational
       questions that drive out time to work effectively on long term
       issues such as how to go about amending the Telecommunications 
       Business Law  to allow bandwidth trading explicitly    This would seem
       important to reduce long term risks to our business strategy 

    Digital Divide

       I had been giving intermittent support to helping Scott Yeager and 
Justin
       Cornett of EBS and Will Reed of Technology for All figure out how
       to expand the concept of Technology for All to Asia    The strategy
       was to utilize some of Japans  billion pledge of funds to support
       digital divide activities in Asia  to support the expansion into Asia 
of
       the EBSsupported TFA model    This work will cease unless it can 
       be picked up by Laura Lannarone of corporate social responsbility 
       or Steve Burns of the DC office

Gentlemen

I just got off the phone with David Stark who wanted to better understand the 
thinking behind Enrons preference for a smaller marketing deal rather than 
the full sponsorship that Uva and Stark pitched last week  I reiterated to 
him that we would not normally entertain such a large deal without a 
significant commercial transaction or series of transactions and that the 
size of the opportunity set currently in front of us only justified 
discussing the smaller marketing deal as indicated in Steves email  Stark 
pressed to know what value we wanted to see in the set of AOL TWX Turner CNN 
deals that are underway currently  He was clear in stating that if we had a 
number in mind he could push other parts of the organization to direct 
business our way sufficient to meet our needs to justify a larger 
sponsorship  I declined to give him a value but I think we should discuss 
this in some detail  

Ill get in touch to set something up

		 Subject Update Third Session  Day   PRINCIPALS MEET SATURDAY

Friday January  

By the end of the day the Treasury had decided to move forward and hold 
another meeting with the CEOs Governor Davis and various other Government 
officials  Governor Davis refused to come to California so a video 
conference was set up with two locations  one at DOE in Washington and one 
in Los Angeles for the Governor and his entourage  It was tentatively set up 
for  pm CST  I have had no reports on the meeting yet Ken Lay Steve 
Kean and Rick Shapiro attended for Enron

LongTerm Forward Contracts

Good progress was made and the report was completed by  pm  It includes a 
draft RFO draft standard contract a table of utilties needs products 
required and a timetable that would have power flowing by February 
Participants were fairly pessimistic about the eventual outcome however 
given the absence of any buyin or participation by the State of California


Debt and Forebearance

Group also worked to have draft documents completed by COB Friday


QF Contract Reformation

Parties continued discussion
No information was available by COB Friday

Major Issues

State interest in resolving
State willingness to raise retail rates
Utilties desire to offload all risk to the State as its portfolio manager
Willingness to call off the dogs for the suppliers and to release them from 
legal action
State willingness to offer up sites for power plant development
Ability to reach deal on QF contract reformation


Next Steps

If definitive agreement is not reached by the principals at Saturday meeting 
this work ends immediately and utilities will likely file for bankruptcy the 
week of Jan 

If agreement is reached a massive amount of work is required immediately 
such as
FERC filing of settlement and ISO Tariff change by Tuesday Jan 
RFO completion and release by Jan 
Introduction and passage of necessary legislation to be executed by February 

Preparation of contract between utilities and state probably DWR
Preparation of formal agreements among the parties on the terms on this 
settlement

And more

Thanks again for coming to Houston this week

CNN has a compelling brand and we believe that a number of the components of 
your proposal are worth exploring further

However we are not interested in pursuing discussions of the exclusive 
sponsorship

I want to stress though that many of the elements of the package you and 
David presented are of interest and we would like to continue discussions 
with you

Please get in touch with us to discuss how we proceed from here

2001-01-11T10:49:00-08:00,"Notes from Bryson conversation with Ken Lay

Urged us to stay at the table

Says teams in Washington have all the demand curves from the utilities from 
which to calculate offering prices

QF meeting starts at  pm tonight
says average cost of QFs today is  kwh amounts to  of supply
believes that cost can be brought down significantly if gas is purchased 
forward perhaps by state entity

Says all utility generation another  mostly hydro and nuclear is cost 
based at   kwh

If suppliers come in at  or even  there is room under the  new 
commodity rate component to recover securitized costs amounts to about  
of SCE supply

Says good progress was made today  Believes they may have a framework this 
evening

Believes  is causing problem maybe room to squeeze it up perhaps as 
high as 

Thinks governor will slightly increase rates or pay more at government 
facilities if the parties can get  of the way to a solution

Thinks its nearly a done deal that DWR state entity will buy power

Says securitization may be harder to get

Brysons questions to Ken and Kens to us  Are we willing to forbear 
payment of amounts owed to us and continue to sell power to the utilities 
over the next several weeks  Ken realizes that Bryson may be overstating the 
progress made and made no commitments to Bryson

Dear Ken Congratulations on the Bush presidency Theres a lot of us out 
here from both parties who think that after Bush has finished his terms that 
you would be an ideal President yourself I know you are very busy so I just 
wanted to bring to your attention two individuals I would highly recommend to 
serve at the Department of Energy First Daryl Owen would be a great 
candidate for Deputy He was the former staff Director of the Senate Energy 
Committee under Bennett Johnston and is very familiar with energy issues but 
also with all the weapons issues I can speak at lenght about his abilities 
having known him for over  years He also has a great respect on the Hill 
Secondly I know you know Don Santa who would like to return to Government 
Service Im not sure what the new administration will do for the 
Chairma ns hip of FERC with Curt Hebert but Don who is a Republican would 
be a 
great choice also He has very good support on the Hill has served at a 
post at LGE and is also a very good policy fellow Thanks for any 
consideration you might give I can be reached by any of your folks at The 
Williard office building  or at home at   This 
retirement stuff is interesting  The energy business is even more so 
Always the best Have a great new Year Rick Richard

		 Subject Brief Summary of Todays Activities in California at Least Thus 
Far

The Commission voted out the order  essentially as it appeared 
yesterday  Three key changes
They clarified that the surcharge applies to Direct Access customers but the 
entire rate freeze structure remains intact for now
The Commission reversed itself and chose not to adopt TURNs netting out of 
gen revenues and CTC collections and said instead that the Commission will 
consider it as an option in the next phase a move likely made in order to 
lower chances of a successful utility appeal
The Commission added to the decision language saying that it will study the 
pros cons of securitizating the utilities power purchase costs  They will 
submit a report on the issue to the Governor and Legislature
On this last point wire reports are rampant about the possibility that 
legislation will be introduced as early as today proposing to securitize the 
utilties power purchase costs  This action has reportedly been the result 
of discussions that occured through the night between the governors office 
the utilities and the ratings agencies in reponse to the fact that the 
decision issued by the PUC falls well short of whats needed to keep the IOUs 
credit worthy and solvent  As a result of those wires stories the 
utilities stock has come back Edison was down as low as  and is 
currently at    PGE was at    and is currently at     Were 
working with Sandi McCubbin who headsup our legislative activities in 
California to get more info and will report back
The hearing was dominated by highly charged antigenerator antimarketer 
rhetoric which is likely to play a prominent role in the press accounts  
Only FERC was demonized more
Each of the Commissioners including the most recent interim appointee  
made strong statements regarding the undesirability of utility bankruptcy
The Commission left open the possibility of doing more at their next 
meeting two weeks from today which means the negotiations with the 
utilities and ratings agencies are likely to continue And if an agreement is 
reached it could end up on the next agenda"
2001-01-04T08:14:00-08:00,"I spent a little over  minutes with Robert  He is a very sharp guy and has 
a great deal of relevant government experience  While I dont have a 
position that would be suitable for his experience level all of my senior 
positions are filled he is definitely someone I would consider if I had an 
open position

My impression from Robert is that while he has some interest in Public 
Affairs his main interest is in a commercial position  I stressed to him 
that it would be difficult to come into Enron to run a business but he could 
build to it over time  His main concern was that he not get lost in the 
system if he came in at a level below business unit head

I think Robert would be a good addition to Enron if  he is willing to come 
in to a commercial role at a more junior level to learn the system and  we 
can make sure that he gets the opportunity to have contact with senior levels 
of the organization from time to time

		 Subject Meeting with Governor Davis need for additional 
comments suggestions

We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA  In attendance were Ken Lay 
the Governor the Governors staff director Kari Dohn and myself  The gov 
spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his 
ideas  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next 
week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday  
Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed based on 
my discussions with several of you as well as some background materials Jeff 
Dasovich and I prepared  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our 
proposals the governors ideas as well as my overview of the situation 
based on the governors comments

Overview   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that 
we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing 
communication with his administration The gov does not want the utilities to 
go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief more modest than what 
the utilities are looking for and credit guarantees  His staff has more 
work to do on the latter but he was clearly intrigued with the idea  He 
talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail 
level  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the 
benefit of California consumers including utilityowned generation which he 
would dedicate to consumers on a costplus basis and excess muni power 
which he estimates at MW  He foresees a mix of market oriented 
solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix 
the problem by  and provide some political cover
Our proposals  I have attached the outline we put in front of him it also 
included the forward price information several of you provided  He seemed 
interested in  the buy down of significant demand  the state setting a 
goal of x MW of new generation by a date certain  getting the utilities 
to gradually buy more power forward and  setting up a group of rate 
analysts and other nonadvocates to develop solutions to a number of issues 
including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities  
He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas 
purchases   As already mentioned he was also favorably disposed to finding 
some state sponsored credit support for the utilities
His ideas  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously 
under serious consideration and some of which were mere brainstorming  
Some of these ideas would require legislative action
State may build or make build transfer arrangements a couple of 
generation plants  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that 
they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases  This 
was a frequently recurring theme
Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a costplus 
basis to consumers
Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in 
California
State universities including UC CSU and the community colleges would more 
widely deploy distributed generation
Expand instate gas production
Take state lands gas royalties in kind
negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for 
addtional gas supplies
Empower an existing state agency to approve coordinate power plant 
maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at 
any one time
Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state
Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function  he wants to hear 
more about how Nordpool worksJeff someone in Schroeders group should be 
able to help out here
Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state  We made 
some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy 
some portion of their forward requirements from new instate generation 
thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control 
approach with generators
Securitize uncollected power purchase costs
To dos Jeff again Id like to prevail on you to assemble the groups 
thoughts and get them to Kari
He wants to see  year fixed power prices for peak  offpeak and baseload  
not just the  one year strips
He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday
He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the 
deal
He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the 
forward contracting issues
Thanks to everyone for their help  We made some progress today

California Hearings Continue 
CPUC Decision Expected This Week 



by Will McNamara 
Director Electric Industry Analysis

 

Hearings aimed at giving consumer advocates and utility officials in 
California the chance to air their views on a looming electricity rate 
increase are expected to continue through today setting the stage for a 
decision by regulators that very well may not please everyone Officials from 
Southern California Edison SCE and Pacific Gas  Electric PGE have asked 
the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC to grant immediate rate 
hikes of as much as  percent to help offset rising wholesale power prices 
The CPUC board is expected to announce on Jan  how much of a rate hike it 
will allow and under what terms 

Analysis Despite the lull of the holiday week just now completed the 
spotlight continues to grow more intense over Californias energy market 
both throughout the energy industry and across the mainstream media As we 
wait with anticipation to hear what the CPUC will decide lets recap some of 
the issues that will no doubt continue to cause great dissension among the 
primary players in California 

As has been well documented PGOand SCE are in a massive amount of debt due 
to uncollected costs they have accrued related to the purchase of power on 
the wholesale market Due to rate freezes still in place both utilities have 
been unable to charge customers for the dramatic increase in the price of 
wholesale power which has placed them both on the brink of bankruptcy 

From several conversations with my contacts in California heres my 
understanding of where the negotiations currently stand The CPUC already has 
agreed in theory to a rate increase but the sticking point is the specific 
amount of that increase Reportedly the CPUC and Gov Gray Davis proposed a 
percent rate hike to the two utilities In sharp contrast PGOmaintains 
that it needs to increase rates by as much as  percent and SCE says that 
it wants an increase of  percent or  percent over two years In fact 
PGOalready began notifying customers last week that it wants to boost their 
electric bills by that specific amount Both utilities continue to argue that 
even if their proposed rate increases are accepted they still may not be 
enough to cover wholesale costs which are projected to rise through  
see my IssueAlert from Dec  In addition PGOand SCE also claim that 
their financial solvency still will not be guaranteed even if their rate 
increase proposals are accepted and bankruptcy will be very likely if the 
CPUC only allows them to increase rates by  percent  

Over the last few weeks pressure was put on the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission FERC to step in and solve the problem However FERC issued its 
own order in early December that mainly focused on mechanisms to keep power 
generators active in the state and did not adequately address the core issues 
of high wholesale prices and rate freezes Due to the lukewarm response that 
FERCs order received it has been generally concluded that the CPUC and Gov 
Davis alone will have to solve the California energy crisis  

It is important to not overlook or discount the role that consumer advocates 
are playing in the negotiations Harvey Rosenfield a longtime critic of the 
states utilities who led the failed attempt to overturn deregulation in 
California in  remains very vocal that the people of California should 
not have to pay one more penny to bail out the utilities for the mistakes 
they made Consumer groups led by Rosenfield and Ralph Nader continue to put 
enormous pressure on Gov Davis a Democrat to keep any rate increase given 
to the utilities to a minimum In fact last week Nader stated that Davis 
political future hangs by a kilowatt hour and that any decisions made in 
California will reverberate all over the country In essence consumer 
groups believe that utilities share the bulk of responsibility for the 
current mess in the state as they played a large role in Californias  
restructuring legislation If mistakes were made in that legislation 
consumer groups say the utilities and not utility customers should be made 
to pay the price  

Speculation is growing that on Jan  the CPUC will approve an increase for 
extra costs that will be applied in increments over the course of  
resulting in an ultimate rate increase that is somewhere in the range of  
percent to  percent or more This in effect will offer a compromise to 
both sides The utilities will receive a rate increase closer to what they 
claim is necessary and utility customers will not get slapped with an 
immediate allatonce increase in their electricity bills However the CPUC 
probably will not approve any back billing that the utilities have also 
demanded Both PGOand SCE have claimed that their stranded costs were 
probably paid off months ago meaning that the rate freeze still in place for 
both utilities should have been lifted as a result That theory being 
accurate both companies want to bill their customers retroactively to the 
date that the rate freeze should have been lifted which on its own could 
amount to several billions of dollars Under the current arrangement the 
rate freeze is scheduled to stay in effect until March  unless lifted by 
the CPUC 

Meanwhile the question about the financial solvency of both PGOand SCE 
continues to loom SCEs parent Edison International announced that it has 
eliminated its fourthquarter dividend and reduced its work force by  jobs 
because of financial problems related to SCE In a statement last week 
PGOCEO Gordon Smith acknowledged that PGOhas virtually exhausted its 
financial resources because it has borrowed on average  million per hour 
to pay for power that it is obligated to provide to California consumers  

Both utilities have argued that the real cause of the problem in the state is 
the generators who unjustifiably continue to charge exorbitant rates for 
power on the wholesale market There may be some validity to this theory as 
power generators who operate in California know that the states IOUs have 
essentially been stripped of their own ability to generate power and thus are 
heavily dependent on power bought on the wholesale market This has given an 
enormous amount of market power to the generators and allowed them to charge 
rates that are not reflective of their own costs Some reports indicate that 
generators are charging as much as  times what it costs them to generate 
power Yet without a cap on wholesale rates generators remain able to 
charge whatever price the market will bear  

Due to these high costs some power generators have begun refusing to sell 
power to the California IOUs out of fear that the utilities will not be able 
to pay their bills In an ironic twist the same companies that have 
expressed concern about selling power to PGOand SCE actually own and control 
the plants that were divested by the two utilities as part of their 
agreements in the states restructuring plan Thus companies outside of and 
inside California that own California plants are refusing to sell power back 
into the state power produced at plants that were once owned by PGOand SCE 

As a result PGOwent on record last week saying that it may not have enough 
power to serve customers in February unless additional rulings come from the 
CPUC PGOsays that it has enough power to supply customers through January 
but that  to  suppliers have demanded payment up front before selling 
natural gas to the utility in February Due to its current debt situation 
PGOclaims that it cannot make any payments up front and thus may not be able 
to buy natural gas to serve its customers  

These issues have formed the landscape across which negotiations still rage 
on in California Much pressure is now being placed on the CPUC to formulate 
an endall solution to the states problems one that can appease all the 
dissenting stakeholders Yet much like FERCs order which was criticized for 
not going far enough the CPUC is particularly challenged to make decisions 
that can once and for all solve the states structural problems As Enrons 
Kenneth Lay said a few months ago the CPUC must avoid putting bandaids on 
Californias hemorrhaging wounds and instead complete a successful 
reconstructive surgery

		 Subject DRAFT of materials for Governor

Greetings

Attached is the draft  Ive attempted to capture everyones comments  The 
only piece that is not likely to go this evening is the piece providing 
comments on the Governors specific proposals  That will likely go first 
thing tomorrow morning  Youll note that only one of the Governors 
proposals currently has any comments attached to it  Comments on the

Subject CA Price caps

I heard youve been raising a ruckus about our activities on the price caps 
 asking us to do more  Thanks  I feel as if I have been a voice in the 
wilderness for the past six months when I was trying to get people to pay 
attention to the bad things happening in CA and warning that the problems 
mainly a threat of reregulation will spread elsewhere

Subject Spencer Abraham note from Janine and Barbara

Rick We just heard the news that Spencer Abraham is being named Secretary of 
Energy  Jim Crawford our lobbyist in Michigan has an excellent 
relationship with Spencer Abraham  They are very good friends from their 
college days and through the  years  They have also worked together on 
numerous political campaigns

Last October at Governor Englers request Ken Lay wrote a personal check for 
 and we issued a corporate check for  to the chamber of 
commerce to support Spencer  This is not to mention any other support he may 
have recieved from our PAC

Jim has always been willing in the past to faciliate meetings with Senator 
Abraham and will still be willing to do so with Secretary Abraham  I am sure 
our DC office has a relationship with him but feel free to contact Jim 
Crawford should you need any assistance  He can be reached at

Bailout Should Leave Us Cold 

Another Utility Bailout Should Leave Us Cold 
George Miller
Sunday December   
 San Francisco Chronicle

DDTL 
OUR CURRENT energy problems are urgent and serious But before the governor 
and the Public Utilities Commission cut yet another deal costing consumers 
billions of dollars perhaps they should pause to ask the public what kind of 
system it wants and what it will end up with after investing billions more 
Failure of energy deregulation could speed real deregulation that might 
benefit consumers with real capacity and real competition But this will not 
happen if the focus is only on California utilities and their shareholders 
The original deregulation deal was designed as I see it to keep competition 
out of California  and to maximize the rates consumers would pay for every 
bad past business decision by PGE and other California utilities 
Similarly current bailout discussions are about forcing California 
ratepayers to pay for the failed deregulation plan designed by the utilities 
themselves Once again the companies seek to maximize profits and socialize 
the losses 
Following on the heels of Californias deregulation the states utilities 
came to the congressional delegation and urged us to protect the plan from 
federal deregulation efforts They argued that the deal they cut was good for 
all parties Their executives repeated time and again that they might benefit 
from the plans cap on consumer prices  and that there was a risk to them 
if wholesale prices were to go up 
This they told us is the marketplace They were willing to absorb the risk 
This was the brave new world of free markets 
But markets are never free From the beginning this deregulation plan was 
designed to buy the California utilities time and advantage Initially 
consumers saw lower rates but not as low as real competition might have 
provided when compared to the heavily sheltered market of the past five 
years Now because this rigged marketplace has failed the utilities want 
again to put their hands into the ratepayers pockets 
At first PGE and Southern California Edison asked the Public Utilities 
Commission to have California consumers pay the entire cost of deregulations 
risks Their idea did not pass the smell or the laugh test 
Now the utilities look for a way to repackage their old proposal including a 
substantial rate increase The rationale is that the utilities may collapse 
financially This threat is supposed to inspire Gov Gray Davis and the PUC 
to quickly put the ratepayer on the hook for the utilities failures 
During the past year dozens of utilities have merged all across America 
PGE for example may not be worth much to its shareholders but like ATT 
it may be worth something to its competitors This is the genius of the 
American marketplace 
PGE shareholders bought the stock assuming the risk Why should the 
ratepayers be asked to insulate them from that risk During this past year 
tens of billions of dollars of market capitalization were lost by various 
Silicon Valley hightech firms Their shareholders do not get the benefit of 
going to the PUC and getting a taxpayer bailout 
The ratepayer has already paid for this energy under a contract that 
utilities struck with the people of the state of California Any additional 
payment by the ratepayer is a financial bailout Any prudent investor would 
ask what the return will be before handing over billions of dollars The 
ratepayer deserves an answer as well as some equity or other consideration

Steve


I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail  If 
you need to call with questions my home number is 









As far as recommendations here is a short list

   Examine LDCs incentive rate program  Current methodology rewards sales 
above monthly index without enough consideration of future 
      replacement cost  The result is that the LDCs sell gas that should be 
injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index
                    This creates a shortage in later months

   California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet 
demand  Investigate why it wasnt maximized operationally  
                      Specific questions should include  

    Why in March May   werent total system receipts higher in order 
to fill storage

    Why are there so many examples of OFOs on weekends that push away too 
much gas from Socals system  
       I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their 
own demand  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than 
their injection capablity but injected far less

   Similar to the power market  there is too much benchmarking to short 
term prices  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major 
                    LDCs  By design the customers are short at a floating 
rate  This market has been long historically  It has been a buyers market 
and the 
     consumer has benefitted  


Call me if you need any more input

Subject What we would like Lay to get from Davis  

Marty  This is a summary of our message from this morning for you to send on 
or discuss with Keene  I hope this is helpful  Scott

Whats important
Give solvency to the utilities by guaranteeing no banckruptcy against the 
generation assets of the utilities  Guarantees to be recovered if needed 
through surcharges over  years  This should give the process time for 
thoughtful solutions  Ending the rate freeze now will give the utilities an 
undeserved windfall b alone related to nuclear assets in year 
There should be thoughtful process to determine i how to keep deregulation 
going ii how existing generation assets should be used iii what are the 
value of existing assets iv when is the appropriate time for customers to 
be exposed to the market and v what kind of market structure would be 
appropriate going forward 
Customers should not be dumped into the market now or in the next year 
while it is extremely illiquid due to many errors of the utilities
There should not be retroactive rate making the negative ctc should be paid 
until at least the rate freeze is ended
All customers should be treated equally with respect to existing generation 
assets that they paid for for the past  years
There should be a special hearing called to debate demand side prospects ie 
curtailment etc

Subject  Re Cayote II PROJECT

I think Paul Kaufman made the call on this from Steve Keanes shop I
think it was the right call given the complexity of the regulatory issues
involved  Larry L Izzo at ENRONDEVELOPMENT    PM 
Importance  High



Peggy we had wanted to add NEPCO to the bid list of bidders for the EPC
bid for the Cayote II Project  Greg Piper has informed me that PGE is of
the opinion that we cannot even have NEPCO participate in the bid because
PGE does not think that would be able to get by the regulators

Before accepting this as fact can you confirm that we can not even 
participate in the bid process because NEPCO is an affiliate of Enron  It 
seems that the best interest of the rate payers is in getting a winning 
competitive bid  Are affiliates precluded from competitive bids in this 
process

Again I dont want to accept a no without insuring that its absolutely 
necessary  Thanks for your help

on both a state and federal level  Whether this country does anything 
meaningful to deal with the current crisis comes donw to one person  Linda

hard elsewhere in the country and coming up with messages to arm our 
remaining allies around the country   THis is the biggest time for us on 
this issue since the very beginnings in California and New Hampshire  In the 
current panic however we will be decimated if we are associated only with a 
move to keep price caps from going into effect I saw your message to Mona  
I am going to read the comments next but I start off thinking we need to 
avoid running headlong into the price cap movement we may be better off 
trying to coopt the movement to get broader reform

		 Subject Meeting with Governor Davis need for additional 
comments suggestions

We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA  In attendance were Ken Lay 
the Governor the Governors staff director Kari Dohn and myself  The gov 
spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his 
ideas  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next 
week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday  
Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed based on 
my discussions with several of you as well as some background materials Jeff 
Dasovich and I prepared  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our 
proposals the governors ideas as well as my overview of the situation 
based on the governors comments

Overview   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that 
we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing 
communication with his administration The gov does not want the utilities to 
go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief more modest than what 
the utilities are looking for and credit guarantees  His staff has more 
work to do on the latter but he was clearly intrigued with the idea  He 
talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail 
level  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the 
benefit of California consumers including utilityowned generation which he 
would dedicate to consumers on a costplus basis and excess muni power 
which he estimates at MW  He foresees a mix of market oriented 
solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix 
the problem by  and provide some political cover
Our proposals  I have attached the outline we put in front of him it also 
included the forward price information several of you provided  He seemed 
interested in  the buy down of significant demand  the state setting a 
goal of x MW of new generation by a date certain  getting the utilities 
to gradually buy more power forward and  setting up a group of rate 
analysts and other nonadvocates to develop solutions to a number of issues 
including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities  
He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas 
purchases   As already mentioned he was also favorably disposed to finding 
some state sponsored credit support for the utilities
His ideas  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously 
under serious consideration and some of which were mere brainstorming  
Some of these ideas would require legislative action
State may build or make build transfer arrangements a couple of 
generation plants  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that 
they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases  This 
was a frequently recurring theme
Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a costplus 
basis to consumers
Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in 
California
State universities including UC CSU and the community colleges would more 
widely deploy distributed generation
Expand instate gas production
Take state lands gas royalties in kind
negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for 
addtional gas supplies
Empower an existing state agency to approve coordinate power plant 
maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at 
any one time
Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state
Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function  he wants to hear 
more about how Nordpool worksJeff someone in Schroeders group should be 
able to help out here
Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state  We made 
some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy 
some portion of their forward requirements from new instate generation 
thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control 
approach with generators
Securitize uncollected power purchase costs
To dos Jeff again Id like to prevail on you to assemble the groups 
thoughts and get them to Kari
He wants to see  year fixed power prices for peak  offpeak and baseload  
not just the  one year strips
He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday
He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the 
deal
He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the 
forward contracting issues
Thanks to everyone for their help  We made some progress today

		 Subject Bush Energy Policy  Powder River Basin

Hello Steve  I hope you and your family had a great holiday  Steve I heard 
on a talk show that the Bush Energy Policy would tackle such topics as 
Alaskan Gas ANWR and also would mention the Powder River coal bed methane 
play  I would like to get a copy of the Energy Policy when it becomes 
available   I would also like everyone to be aware of the large investments 
made and planned by Northern Border Partners in the Powder River and Wind 
River Basins of Wyoming  In addition the Denver office of Enron North 
America has a large stake in gas trading in the Rockies   Everything 
considered the development of Rocky Mountain gas reserves including the 
gathering and pipeline infrastructure will be less controversial than ANWR 
and will get gas to markets much sooner  For example Northern Border 
Partners expects to file at the FERC by the rd quarter of  for the Bison 
Pipeline project which will connect Powder River reserves to NBPL in  
versus  for Alaskan gas  You can see the latest on the Bison project 
at Inside FERC December th page 

One pending federal action that would do much to enhance coal bed methane 
production is the completion of an EIS  presently being prepared by the 
BLM   The timely issuance of a favorable EIS would open thousands of federal 
acres in Wyoming and Montana to drilling by coal bed methane producers and 
would assist gas in getting to market within Bushs first term in office    
I hope Enron and the new administration can set Powder River gas as a 
priority item in the coming year "

I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail  If 
you need to call with questions my home number is 









As far as recommendations here is a short list

   Examine LDCs incentive rate program  Current methodology rewards sales 
above monthly index without enough consideration of future 
      replacement cost  The result is that the LDCs sell gas that should be 
injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index
                    This creates a shortage in later months

   California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet 
demand  Investigate why it wasnt maximized operationally  
                      Specific questions should include  

    Why in March May   werent total system receipts higher in order 
to fill storage

    Why are there so many examples of OFOs on weekends that push away too 
much gas from Socals system  
       I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their 
own demand  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than 
their injection capablity but injected far less

   Similar to the power market  there is too much benchmarking to short 
term prices  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major 
                    LDCs  By design the customers are short at a floating 
rate  This market has been long historically  It has been a buyers market 
and the 
     consumer has benefitted  


Call me if you need any more input

This looks good  It comes across as moderate in tone although probably no 
one else will ask to leave the rate freeze in place 

I have a legal question  Under AB  I dont see anyway that the CPUC 
can raise rates without ending the rate freeze first  Am I missing 
something So how is it clear that the CCPUC can raise the rates on Feb   
Its clearhowever  that once the retained assets are valued that the rates 
can be changed

SCIENTECH IssueAlert December  
Exelon Completes Acquisition of  Percent of Sithe
By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis


Exelon Corporation and Sithe Energies Inc announced the successful 
completion 
of Exelons acquisition of  percent of the stock of Sithe The remaining 
 percent of Sithe will be owned by Vivendi  percent Marubeni Corp 
 percent and Sithe Management  percent Vivendi Universal retains 
a blocking minority interest of  percent in the company and PECO Energy 
which along with Unicom formed Exelon Corp becomes Sithes main 
shareholder 
PECO has also been given a threeyear commitment starting from December 
 to buy Vivendi Universals remaining interest 

ANALYSIS The announcement of this acquisition was first made in August 
prior to the formation of Exelon Corp Under the original agreement dated 
Aug   PECO Energy is purchasing  percent of Sithes North 
American assets including its domestic marketing and development businesses 
for  million The acquisition marks a new direction for Sithe Energies 
and a continuation of an aggressive generation expansion plan on the part 
of Exelon 

This divestiture by Sithe Energies signals its withdrawal from power 
production 
Only two years ago Sithe Energies was one of the largest independent power 
producers in the United States operating  power plants from New Jersey 
to California Sithe Energies had made a decided effort to purchase vast 
generation assets in the Northeastern United States believing that there 
would be value in having critical mass in the deregulated generation market 
in that region Until last year Sithe Energies was the primary subsidiary 
of French megautility Vivendi which had been creating a reputation as 
an industry powerhouse due to its assets in electric energy services thermal 
energy supply water distribution and wastewater management Interestingly 
Vivendi did not own a gas or electric utility anywhere in the world and 
instead used Sithe Energies as the vehicle to accumulate generation assets 
as its primary entry into the energy industry 

Indications that the companys strategy was changing began to surface earlier 
this year In February Sithe Energies sold  power plants to Reliant 
Energy for a total of  billion The sale generated an immediate capital 
gain of about  million for Sithe Energies indicating that its generation 
assets were bringing strong shareholder value for its investors even if 
the company appeared to be exiting the generation market

Then in June Vivendi announced that it had entered into a strategic 
business combination with Canal and The Seagram Company Ltd to form a 
new company called Vivendi Universal a communications conglomerate for 
wired and wireless markets owning the worlds largest music company second 
largest film library major film production studio and a PCbased software 
game publishing company Note that just yesterday Vivendi Universal entered 
into an agreement for the sale of Seagrams spirits and wine business to 
Diageo and Pernod Ricard for  billion subject to regulatory approvals 
Vivendi also continued to expand its significant water business through 
its subsidiaries US Filter Corporation and Gnrale des Eaux Group which 
recently won water treatment contracts New Zealand and Indonesia In a 
separate development Vivendi supported by Sithe Energies developed a 
partnership with a company named Softbank to establish a unit called K 
Road Ventures This company represented Vivendis strategy of creating 
an Internet company specializing in BtoB services for utilities and energy 
services

All of these developments indicated that although Vivendi planned to remain 
involved in the energy industry its focus was no longer on building a 
generation portfolio through Sithe Energies Rather Vivendi is building 
on its role as a major player in communications and environmental services 
The subtext of this new direction for the company is probably Vivendis 
attempt to reduce the debt of its subsidiaries to a reported  billion 
euros by the end of this year Yet most financial analysts agree that 
the continuing divestiture of Sithe Energies marks Vivendis complete 
withdrawal 
from the energy production business Vivendi has been in the process of 
spinning off a new utilities arm named Vivendi Environnment which will 
provide energy services such as equipment installation and maintenance 
as well as water and wastewater treatment The K Road Ventures unit probably 
will be operated within Vivendi Environnment however it appears fairly 
certain that generation is no longer a part of the companys primary strategy

According to Vivendi this divestiture confirms the exit of Sithe North 
America from the consolidation scope of Vivendi Universal Including the 
divestiture of GPU which took place at the beginning of the year the 
transactions represent a total debt reduction of around  billion euros 
and a net capital gain of  million euros in the financial statements 
for 

Presently across North America Sithe Energies still owns and operates 
about  power generation plants with approximately  MW of net merchant 
generating capacity Further divestiture of these assets is expected as 
Sithe and Vivendi continue to move away from power generation PECO now 
Exelon and Reliant are two companies that have quickly picked up the 
generation 
assets divested by Sithe Energies and has been a wise move for both 
companies 
There should be a continuing high value placed on generation assets in 
the Northeastern United States particularly since competitive markets 
are developing more rapidly in that region of the country Reliants purchase 
of the Sithe Energies  plants supports its strategy of acquiring 
generation 
assets and developing a strong retail capability 

Purchasing  percent of Sithe Energies with the option to buy the rest 
of the company in as little as two years is also a smart move for Exelon 
The Power Generation Group PGG of PECO which remains a subsidiary under 
the new Exelon holding company is the business unit responsible for managing 
the fossil and hydro generating stations of the company PGG manages a 
fleet of  generating units that can provide  megawatts MW of power 
using a variety of fuels These units include coal natural gas oil 
landfill 
gas and hydroelectric power plants Under deregulation this variety of 
fuels is helping PECO to remain competitive and prepared to meeting the 
energy needs of diverse customers Presently Exelon is the largest energy 
company in the United States but will trumped by the Entergy FPL Group 
combination which is expected to close over the next year 

The addition to Exelons generation arsenal that it gains from almost half 
the shares of Sithe Energies should factor in nicely to Exelons overall 
position in the industry Exelon estimates that the initial investment 
in Sithe will contribute approximately  per share to its consolidated 
earnings in  and  And it certainly appears that Exelon aims to 
acquire the totality of Sithes assets based on comments coming out of 
the companys headquarters If Exelon were to purchase the remaining  
percent of Sithe as soon as two years from now Exelon anticipates that 
the transaction would contribute approximately  to its annual 
consolidated 
earnings This may be just the move that Exelon has in mind as a complete 
acquisition of Sithes assets would increase Exelons generation portfolio 
to  MW which is perhaps just what it needs to secure its place as 
one of the nations top generating companies and keep it in the running 
with FPL   Entergy

		 Subject water opportunity

I meant to send you an article some time ago on the UK water business now 
cannot find it  I do not make it my habit to follow this sector and we 
have never discussed my following this here in the UK  However I just 
wanted you to be aware and you can pass along as you see fit that recent 
developments in the UK water sector should create new business opportunities 
for Wessex and indeed trade press here reports as much  I am also not 
trying to end run either Colin Skellett CEO or Keith Harris reg affaris 
at Wessex both of whom I have a high regad for  just wanted to get this 
into the right circles  The development is the mutualisation of water 
distribution companies  This was proposed last year by Kelda in England 
and turned down by the water regulator  It is essentially securitising the 
future income streams of the pipes business servicing bonds and making the 
customers the owners there is essentially no equity stake  Thus the 
license obligation to invest in infrastructure is on the customers themselves 
raises interesting enforcement problems  The services part of the 
business is outsourced on a competitive basis this is where Wessex would 
come in  As I noted such a proposal has previously been rejected  Now 
though it is proposed to mutualise the Welsh water company  Normally the 
regulator would reject this for being unsound along the same lines as the 
earlier proposal  However the leaders of this mutualisation effort in 
Wales are  of the great and the good leaders of the Welsh business 
community and it is seen as a source of Welsh national pride to take back 
ownership of their water industry ie meaning it is going to happen  We 
now have a new water regulator who is smart enough not to stand in the way of 
Welsh politics and has said he thinks the proposal has some merit and he 
will look not reject it out of hand  Wessex could bid on the services 
agreement for this company and if approved this mutualisation will open 
the door for others to follow and and hence more opportunities for Wessex  
Hope this is of some interest and use to you   mcs

Pete

I would like to weigh in on this if you dont mind  First of all  I 
requested meetings with the audit and EHS folks to understand our procedures 
and our status  So no fair ranting at Don  Secondly your note brings to 
mind what I find the most troublesome about our process as it currently 
stands  It is not now nor will it be in the future the audit departments 
responsibility to ensure that corrective actions are taken as a result of the 
audit process  It is the responsibility of the business leader and the 
business management  So follow up with the companies should have been a 
communication from you to the business unit head not from Don to the 
business and Don to you  

But we are going to work all of this out and in the meantime we arent 
going to get crosswise with each other  This is going to be an open kimono 
kind of place and no information is going to be managed away from me  I will 
be staying on top of things and I will be involved with all of the support 
groups with the business leaders and with the executive managment  And 
problems that are uncovered will be owned by all of us responsible for the 
business and the appropriate handling of those issues will be a matter of 
performance between the business and myself

So please calm down and lets all get off on the right foot  Enjoy your 
holiday darn it

Subject CFTC Reauthorization

At his request I met Lee Sachs Assistant Treasury Secretary who had 
requested the meeting after a brief conversation recently  Lee said that 
seniorlevel negotiations led by Secretary Summers were initiated last week 
between the CFTC and SEC and that progress was being made on the single stock 
futures issue the major issue postponing movement of the legislation  

As you know the House completed committee work on HR  before it 
recessed  The bill will now is pending before the Rules Committee where 
differences will be worked out between the three different Committee versions 
Agriculture Commerce and Banking  The Senate Agriculture Committee 
passed out the Senate version in July  However the bill is not moving 
quickly in the Senate due to Senator Phil Gramms desire to see significant 
changes made to the legislation not directly related to our energy 
language Last week at the Republican Convention I asked the Senator about 
the bill and he said they were working on it but much needs to be changed 
for his support  More telling perhaps were Wendy Gramms comments that she 
would rather the current bill die if a better bill can be passed next year  
What this means is that we must at the least remove Senator Gramms 
opposition to the bill to move the process and more importantly seek to gain 
his support of the legislation

Lee Sachs message was just that  I told Lee that we shared his desire to 
move the legislation as long as it contains a full exclusion for all 
nonagriculture commodities including metals  He said that we would have a 
difficult time defending the metals provision politically But Lee said  we 
would not find Treasury opposition to the House Commerce Committee language 
which includes favourable language on energy and metals   This is a 
positive development because it isolates the CFTC from its key defenders and 
I hope ensures no veto threat on our issues  However I do not expect 
Treasury to be vocal in support of our position  It is clear that 
Congressional leaders and the Administration want to get this bill done this 
year and there remains a good opportunity for enactment

However with less than  or so legislative days left we need Senator Gramm 
to engage  A call from Ken Lay in the next two weeks to Senator Gramm could 
be an impetus for Gramm to move his staff to resolve the differences  Gramm 
needs to fully understand how helpful the bill is to Enron  Let me know your 
thoughts on this approach   I am prepared to assist in coordinating the call

Let me know if you agree that we switch to a uniform range of numbers

Regards

Philippe
Proposal for Single Number Range for the New Enron Campus

For the opening of the New Enron Campus and the changing of the street  
address from  Smith St to  Louisiana we propose that 
Enron elects to take a single DID number range for all inbound 
telecommunications
This single number range would bolster the strategic plan of allocating a DID 
to an employee
and that employee can take that number anywhere within the campus in a Plug 
n Play environment

Currently we have over  DIDs in operation in the following locations EB 
 AC  AC    Jeffersen and Penzoil Place  
The numbers are spread across three different ranges 

   xxxx   numbers 
   xxxx   numbers 
   xxxx    numbers 

The proposal is to take a  number range to cover current and future 
requirements The benefits are 

  less confusion to Enron customers and internal users
  sufficient numbers to allow Enron to expand in the downtown area
  increased capacity from one  range of numbers to cater for Fax or 
multimedia applications
  have a new identity to fall in line with One Enron philosophy

Due to the high utilization of DID numbers in the downtown area we will not 
get a  area code allocation and we will be looking at the new   
area code
We have been investigating  ENE XXXX as the range however this 
cannot be guaranteed

To take this forward I require high level approval of the scheme we will 
then pressure the suppliers and regulatory committees to meet Enrons 
requirements

		 Subject EGEP EOGIL Customs Duty Inquiry on Offshore Production

We were served summons by the Customs Office in Surat asking for meetings 
with our platform managers and on Decth we sent two representatives 
operations mgr  legal to answer their questions  Over a two day period 
they inquired about production and logistical issues and asked a number of 
questions regarding product delivery points pricing formulas etc   In 
summary they are trying to build a case that the gas and maybe even the 
crude we sell in India is subject to a  customs duty since it is 
produced outside of the  mile territorial limit  They are trying to make 
the case that we are importing the gas and oil into India  Obviously this is 
not the case and there is no merit for such consideration but we dont want 
to let this idea get entered as a show cause filing against Enron and our 
partners  There would be remedies such as court or arbitration but the 
timing to resolve this is probably  years  Furthermore this issue would 
most likely impact current efforts we have ongoing  Therefore we are 
taking the issue very seriously and plan to meet in Mumbai next Thursday to 
chart an appropriate course of action  Once we meet we will get back to 
Cliff and Jim Derrick regarding our recommendation on Thursday morning 
December st Houston time  Cliff and Jim if you are planning to be out of 
the office please drop me an email where you can be reached

Meeting in Mumbai next Thursday will be Chris Walker of Linklaters local 
Indian counsel Saberwal  myself Mike Stewart Dominic Carolan EGEP 
legal and certain representatives from EOGIL  We would also like to have 
Jane WilsonEIPL Govt  Regulatory affairs for India present if she is 
available  Jane it is not mandatory that you are present but if you cant 
attend could you send me an email where I could reach you if necessary  The 
meeting will be at EOGILs office and Fatima Samuel will confirm the time and 
place once Chris Walkers schedule is known  It is my understanding that 
Chris Walker will be in India on Tuesday and Wednesday working with Wades 
group on other matters 

This issue came up originally in  right after we started producing gas at 
Tapti  At that time we had  legal opinions prepared and the legal team 
tells me the positions were very strong in our favor on a variety of fronts  
After a few meetings and a couple of letters the issue went away and never 
resurfaced again until now  We suspect that this issue has been an open item 
since that time and for a variety of reasons ongoing activities  someone 
feels it needs to be checked off the list  Hence the revived interest at 
this time  

The reason we are giving this such a high level of attention is probably 
obvious but the reason we want to act upon our plan immediately once we get 
together next Thursday may seem less necessary  However today our office 
received  more summons for  different people to report to Surat next 
Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday  This time they have asked for our 
production manager logistics manager and lead accountant  We have requested 
an extension due to the short notice and holiday season and expect to have it 
granted but we will not know if it is postponed before Monday   If we have 
to go we will have legal counsel attend with the individuals named  This 
level of back to back activity for a government office at this time year is a 
concern  Going into the meeting with the legal guys on Thursday we are 
thinking that we need to have a highly respected personsuch as Saberwal 
deliver  our message to multiple groups ie Surat customs Ministry of 
Finance Mopng as to the lack of validity for this potential claim and what 
we would do if they proceed   By Thursday I think we will have all of the 
necessary color on this issue and with the team mentioned above we will be 
able to develop the right plan of action  However due to the level of 
interest and activity of the Surat Customs group we anticipate that our 
recommendation will be to move quickly hence my desire to contact Cliff and 
Jim next Thursday for approval to proceed  

I have included Wade and RebeccaEIPL as well as Steve and JohnPR for 
information purposes at this time    
This first stage plan we will be seeking approval for next Thursday will be 
to meet with certain people in an attempt to keep this from becoming an 
issue  This should be a fairly quiet issue for Indian standards next week 
and even the subsequent meetings that Im anticipating would take place in 
the following two weeks ought to be very low keyed items  However in India 
you never know and considering some of the existing press of recent we should 
get prepared and make sure we are coordinated   John following our 
Thursday decision we should probably talk about our plan so if youll leave 
me a note where you can be reached Id appreciate it  

In summary the odds are we will be able to manage this and it wont become a 
big issue  However we need to take this very seriously and deal with it 
proactively and quickly before someone files something without understanding 
the consequences of the action  I am leaving for India on Sunday and when 
possible I will pick up my mail  I will also be checking voicemail if you 
need to leave a message   I will be the Mumbai office on Tuesday Thursday 
and Friday and in Delhi on Wednesday

Subject CFTC Reauthorization

At his request I met Lee Sachs Assistant Treasury Secretary who had 
requested the meeting after a brief conversation recently  Lee said that 
seniorlevel negotiations led by Secretary Summers were initiated last week 
between the CFTC and SEC and that progress was being made on the single stock 
futures issue the major issue postponing movement of the legislation  

As you know the House completed committee work on HR  before it 
recessed  The bill will now is pending before the Rules Committee where 
differences will be worked out between the three different Committee versions 
Agriculture Commerce and Banking  The Senate Agriculture Committee 
passed out the Senate version in July  However the bill is not moving 
quickly in the Senate due to Senator Phil Gramms desire to see significant 
changes made to the legislation not directly related to our energy 
language Last week at the Republican Convention I asked the Senator about 
the bill and he said they were working on it but much needs to be changed 
for his support  More telling perhaps were Wendy Gramms comments that she 
would rather the current bill die if a better bill can be passed next year  
What this means is that we must at the least remove Senator Gramms 
opposition to the bill to move the process and more importantly seek to gain 
his support of the legislation

Lee Sachs message was just that  I told Lee that we shared his desire to 
move the legislation as long as it contains a full exclusion for all 
nonagriculture commodities including metals  He said that we would have a 
difficult time defending the metals provision politically But Lee said  we 
would not find Treasury opposition to the House Commerce Committee language 
which includes favourable language on energy and metals   This is a 
positive development because it isolates the CFTC from its key defenders and 
I hope ensures no veto threat on our issues  However I do not expect 
Treasury to be vocal in support of our position  It is clear that 
Congressional leaders and the Administration want to get this bill done this 
year and there remains a good opportunity for enactment

However with less than  or so legislative days left we need Senator Gramm 
to engage  A call from Ken Lay in the next two weeks to Senator Gramm could 
be an impetus for Gramm to move his staff to resolve the differences  Gramm 
needs to fully understand how helpful the bill is to Enron  Let me know your 
thoughts on this approach   I am prepared to assist in coordinating the call 
and drafting the talking points for a Ken Lay Sen Gramm call

Attached is an article about deregulation price volatility California power 
issues and how EES and other energy management type of companies are helping 
with solve these problems 



Attached is an article about how PGE is offering incentives to its larger 
customers in California that which asks them to use less energy in turn the 
customers are guaranteed to be blackout free There is a little controversy 
over this issue because the incentive is not offered to small business or 
residents 

"
2000-08-14T10:42:00-07:00,"As I promised this morning at the executive committee meeting below are some 
talking points for your use

Overall message  the market is working regulation is not

In California peak demand rose by  over the last  years while new 
capacity grew by only   But as you would expect the market responded by 
proposing MW of new generation   more than enough to offset the peak 
demand growth  The regulatory process at both the state and local level 
has failed to site this new generation  The problem is regulation not 
deregulation

When San Diego customers began experiencing the effects of higher prices 
Enron responded with a fixed price which would have shielded San Diego 
customers from price volatility and provided prices below their current 
summer levels Enrons price was about  MWH  After publication of 
Enrons offer nine other companies made offers  Again the market responded 
where regulation failed  San Diego has not accepted any of these offers 
because of regulatory legislative restrictions on its ability to buy outside 
of the PX ie the spot market

In markets where siting is easier suppliers have moved to build additional 
generation  Enron built  plants in response to the  price spikes  
Those plants were planned sited and built in less that  months   in time 
for the summer of   Where regulatory hurdles are lower the market 
responds

The solution to current pricing and reliability issues is more competition 
not reregulation  Policy makers should

Open the transmission grid so that power can get from where it is to where it 
is needed

Expedite interconnection of new generation

Expedite siting of new facilities

Give customers a choice so that they have better access to demand side 
solutions

Dasovich of our San Francisco office

Subject Talking Points re reregulation in California

As I promised this morning at the executive committee meeting below are some 
talking points for your use

Overall message  the market is working regulation is not

In California peak demand rose by  over the last  years while new 
capacity grew by only   But as you would expect the market responded by 
proposing MW of new generation   more than enough to offset the peak 
demand growth  The regulatory process at both the state and local level 
has failed to site this new generation  The problem is regulation not 
deregulation

When San Diego customers began experiencing the effects of higher prices 
Enron responded with a fixed price which would have shielded San Diego 
customers from price volatility and provided prices below their current 
summer levels Enrons price was about  MWH  After publication of 
Enrons offer nine other companies made offers  Again the market responded 
where regulation failed  San Diego has not accepted any of these offers 
because of regulatory legislative restrictions on its ability to buy outside 
of the PX ie the spot market

In markets where siting is easier suppliers have moved to build additional 
generation  Enron built  plants in response to the  price spikes  
Those plants were planned sited and built in less that  months   in time 
for the summer of   Where regulatory hurdles are lower the market 
responds

The solution to current pricing and reliability issues is more competition 
not reregulation  Policy makers should

Open the transmission grid so that power can get from where it is to where it 
is needed

Expedite interconnection of new generation

Expedite siting of new facilities

Give customers a choice so that they have better access to demand side 
solutions

Dasovich of our San Francisco office

Dear Mr Kean

I would like to thank you and Mark Schroeder very much for your time and
outstanding hospitality in Houston  I very much enjoyed meeting with you
and your message that your Chairman Kenneth Lay confirmed for dinner with
our Mayor Petra Roth was very well received and we are all very excited and
looking forward to November 

However it raises great interest in the question of organization of the
dinner and the additional participating chairpeople of other companies Will
Enron now invite for that dinner which I understand will be the gathering
of  major decision makers in the energy field If you could be so kind
as to share with us the thoughts of Ken Lays office with regards to that
point or give me a contact there I would very much appreciate

An alternative we discussed or as an addition the next day Lunch would be
that a businessgroup would host an event which could include a wider
audience of business people of Houston  After having spoken with the German
Consulate in Houston and with the German American Chamber here it
unfortunately appears as if they will not be capable for sth we achieve
Everybody recommended to work with the reputative Greater Houston
Partnership whose President was on vacation last week  I would welcome any
assistance in getting us in contact with them  Probably it would not take
too many efforts for Enron to have them consider supporting out idea of
promoting our ideas To help you pass them I again include our plan for
Houston see attached doc

I will be in contact with your colleague Mark Palmer with regards to the
presscoverage Thank you for your response to your earliest possible
convenience

Yours Sincerely

Subject West Virginia Settlement

Thom and I have just completed negotiations in West Virginia involving APS 
AEP and other stakeholders
The settlement being filed today is a compromise on all the issues and is 
the result of negotiations  Enron was the only marketer involved in the 
process  While we weighed in all the issues there are a number of items 
that but for our persistence would not have been included in the final 
agreement  These items include the following

  Native load language
  Competitive metering and billing for industrial and large commercials as 
of day one with other customers following no later than within the next four 
years
  Addition of competitive bidding for default service at end of  years
  Change from functional separation to a requirement to corporately 
separate as soon as possible but no later than within the next five years
  Strong codes of conduct that form the base for more detailed rulemaking  
A special thanks to Lara Leibman for her assistance

Below is a summary of the entire settlement

  All customers can exercise choice beginning January  
  All utilities including IOUs munies and coops can opt in  APS has 
committed to opt in whereas AEP is not because it did not get any stranded 
cost and it also did not get a guarantee of full recovery of all costs 
resulting from the environmental lawsuits against them irrespective of their 
financial condition  
  Competitive metering and billing as described above
  Generation is deregulated
  PSC continues jurisdiction over implemention rate unbundling 
reliability codes of conduct supplier licensing construction of 
transmission lines and eminent domain authority
  Native load language  Requires utilities to provide service to 
affiliated and unaffiliated suppliers only under the applicable distribution 
tariffs and proformatransmission tariffs
  RTOs  Each utility must join a FERC approved RTO or its equivlent by no 
later than     best efforts requirement to eliminate pancaking by    
if IOUs are in separate RTOs
  Competitive bidding process for  default service customers at end of year 
 for remainder of transition period
  Rate unbundling requirement
 Rates capped for first  years with any FERC change in transmission being 
applied as an offset to distribution
Rates continue to be regulated through the th year with the rate gradually 
increasing during the second six years for the residential and small 
commercial customers  For the large commercial and industrial customers the 
rate regulation ends   
  A rate stabilization deferral fund is created to facilitate the 
transition to competition in years   and  under which APS must 
contribute  million and AEP must contribute  million to be used as 
an offset to the prices paid by small residential and commercial default 
customers
  Large commercial and industrial customers receive for the first  years 
rate decreases in an amount to be determined by the Commission for AEP 
customers and  for APS customers  The rate decrease is allocated to 
distribution
  No stranded costs either generating or regulatory assets for AEP or 
APS however APS gets a ten year PURPA surcharge starting at  mills per 
kwh in year one and declining to  mills per kwh in the last two years
  Usual licensing requirements  AEP fought for the right to have a 
second tier of licensing where they would have the ability to certify 
marketers but we defeated that
 Corporate separation and codes of conduct as described above  
 Consumer protection and education requirements typically found in other 
plans
 Low income protection provisions providing a  mil surcharge with the 
minimum being  and the maximum being 
 Utility worker protection plan

Below for your information is the plan




At this point the plan goes to the PSC for approval and then on to the 
legislature for a resoulution approving the PSC order  We expect that AEP 
and labor will oppose it so it will be a close call

Subject Re FERC INVESTIGATION IN CA  What should they be looking for  

Here are some more thoughts
FERC should take a hard look at why the ISO is almost always in an inc 
situation in real time  Without structural incentives to go short into real 
time I would expect the CAISO to inc in some hours and dec in others  
with no consistent patterns
The IOUs have four choices for purchasing power  PX Block Forward PX Day 
Ahead PX Day Of and CAISO Ex Post  They had ample opportunity to purchase 
lower cost power in the PX Block Forward but didnt buy enough  That left 
them short in the Day Ahead  They can reduce Day Ahead prices by moving some 
of their load to the Ex Post market  Dave Parquet did an Econ  
presentation on this incentive at the CAISO board meeting in June
The ISO remains primarily in inc mode even during the shoulder months when 
prices are lower another indicator that the real time inc problem is 
driven by the load side rather than the supply side  The IOUs continue to 
go short into the ISO Ex Post market even when the CAISO Ex Post price is 
consistently above the PX Day Ahead price
There is evidence that the IOUs are not willing to pay above the CAISO price 
cap for energy from the PX in the Day Ahead market  Does it matter that the 
price cap for the ISO also acts as a PX price cap
The NOx market in California is very tight  How has this contributed to 
higher costs and has the complete lack of available NOx credits prevented any 
generators from running
How large was the impact of the below normal water year on the supply side  
The attached presentation quantifies this effect in the Northwest  I have a 
theory on how hydro capacity completely overstates reserve margins in the 
west from an economic perspective  I can go into more detail if you wish
Friction between California PX and ISO markets and other western markets  
For example why are actual flows going into the state yet prices out side of 
the state are higher  Another example of anomylous behavior is at COB on 
  and    There was congestion from California TO the northwest those 
days in the Day Ahead market  In real time the NW ended up being a net 
seller of about  MW from the NW TO California
Demand Side  we really need to press on this issue because all of the 
proponents of price caps claim that as soon as the demand side is workably 
competitive then there is no need for price caps  Is largescale economic 
demand response required for a competitive market  What if demand response 
is there but at very high prices  The demand response in California is a 
joke  With  MW of interuptible why did the utilities and the CAISO only 
get around  MW of economic demand response  Much of this response comes 
at  MWh  The assymetric treatment of supply side resources and demand 
side resources can be justified on environmental grounds but not economic 
grounds  So why this assymetric treatment  This gets to the question of the 
fine line between scarcity rents which are ok and market power which is 
not  If power is scarce and demand truly values it at  MWh then 
shouldnt that be the price  At what price would the rest of the 
interuptible load economically curtail  Bottom line  there are about  
MW of load that should be able to respond to price signals that chooses not 
to or values power at more than  MWh
Burden of proof  what empirical measures should be used to assess market 
power  The reports published to date have been unimpressive  The Market 
Analysis Unit report for example does a bunch of handwaving and then 
concludes that there is market power  But they never explain why  I would 
think that proof might be something like this  Generator X sets price y of 
the time when loads exceed Z MWs  Or four generators set price  of the 
time when prices exceed  MWh  They have all the data to be able to tell 
yet they dont provide any empirical measures  The only test Ive heard of 
so far is the UC Energy Institute report that demonstrates that generators 
are submitting bids above their marginal cost  The PX report states that 
supply bids are fewer and at higher prices than last year  They fail to 
mention the fact that there are  fewer MW of hydro this year relative to 
last

Subject FERC INVESTIGATION IN CA  What should they be looking for

As we begin to meet with FERC Staff on the Wholesale market issues related to 
CA problems I think that we need to put together a list of questions that 
FERC needs to be asking Western power market participants  

The following are some questions that I think are important to have FERC ask 
Im sure there are more

 Were California utilities underscheduling load into the PX day ahead 
market  
 How many MWs did the CA ISO procure during each hour during the Summer 
  How does this compare with CA ISO procurement during 
 Has PGE changed its bidding behavior associated with its Hydro facilities 
in   
 Are there baseload facilities that were operated differently in  than 
in 
 Were any generation plants offline due to unplanned maintenance during 
Summer 
 How did the CA ISO demand side program work  Why didnt more load 
participate  
 What options did SDGE have to hedge its retail rates  What were prices 
in the CAL PX block forward market on Jan   and May  
 How high did natural gas prices go in California for generation during 
Summer 
 Were other Western power markets prices higher yearonyear
 Did the CA ISO Board face political pressure to reduce bid caps  Is this 
appropriate for a FERC jurisdictional entity
 What specific details is SDGE referring to in its Complaint on 
unworkably competitive CA ISO markets  Can these be fixed quickly

Please add other questions

2000-08-21T00:19:00-07:00,"In my interview I stressed that a big part of the communication problem is 
the narrow and impermanent nature of the information about whats going on at 
Enron  Narrow because for every significant activity there are only a few 
who are in the loop and impermanent because very little information is 
committed to writing most of it is exchanged in person or over the phone  
This is I believe what lies at the heart of complaints about 
crossdepartment communication  We now have some solutions emerging  
software that enables more people to record and post information in HTML 
format on company intranet sites  I suspect that using such tools will face 
two obstacles learning how to use them ie theres a huge need for training 
and making it part of our culture as a knowledge learning organization

Subject Computer Based Communications Training Initiative

As agreed in our VV meeting today I have attached two items for your review
 A list of those who have been interviewed or have been part of a focus 
group on this subject

The input from individuals on this list will be the basis for developing the 
 key scenarios that will be a part of the training  Please let me know if 
you feel we should include more people from your unit to insure that your 
units unique circumstances are appropriately taken into account  If so let 
us know either their names or how you would like them to be identified

Some of the individuals on this list will be contacted as Subject Matter 
Experts to help provide real Enron contexts for the scenarios as they are 
further developed

 A list of the first draft objectives for the program and  possible 
scenarios

Since we will only be able to have a total of about  scenarios in the 
final version identify the    on this list of high level scenario ideas 
that will have the most impact on improving communications and the most 
applicability to a range of managers across the Enron organization  Any 
other feedback you can provide on the objectives or scenarios would be 
greatly appreciated

We are seeking to move forward with the development of scenarios by the 
beginning of next week  Therefore if you could provide your feedback on 
both of the items above by Friday August th it would be greatly 
appreciated

2000-08-21T00:29:00-07:00,"My message cut off  The conclusion is that while we continue to need to 
address the kinds of issues laid out in your recommnedations we need to look 
at solutions which may go deeper to adress our communications problems    
solutions which have become available only recently  Why not have these guys 
focus on an online training program to both teach people how to make 
information available and accessible eg by recording information and 
updating on the intranet and demonstrating the importance of this activity 
to the success of the organization

I think you and your team have done a fine job dealing with the traditional 
and perhaps largely insoluble problems that this group wants to take on  I 
am pessimistic that the program outlined below will provide anything other 
than marginal improvements   I am somewhat optimistic though that we may 
be able to bypass many of these problems and get to the heart of what people 
are really complaining about in the survey by instituting real knowledge 
management at Enron

Dear Colleagues
 
On numerous occasions this past year Enron Government Affairs EGA support 
provided to commercial groups resulted in substantial increases in project 
economics and enhanced the overall value of many deals The Regulatory Risk 
Analytics group has been tasked to help you quantify EGAs portion of this 
value added over the past year For budgetary reasons it is critical for 
every EGA member to participate in this exercise and document his her share 
of significant value added  Please contact Gia Maisashvili or John Neslage 
to discuss the  methodology for determining EGAs value added as soon as 
possible   The contact information for Gia is    and for John 
its  

The dead line for this effort is Friday  September st

Thank you for your cooperation

This article is forwarded to you per Mark Palmers request


Business
Enron Plays The Pipes This oldtime gas company is trading fuel for a future 
as a neweconomy
superpower Will the swap work
Frank Gibney Jr Houston

  
Time Magazine
Time Inc

Copyright 

Its Saturday night and the only thing between you and a movie from 
Blockbuster Video is the unpaid late fee for
last weeks rental If that sounds familiar then youll appreciate this 
next year Blockbuster plans to offer up to 
movie titles online in more than a dozen major cities around the US Thats 
right video on demand not the
frustrating norewind nopause payperview offerings of today for anyone 
with a DSL line at home 

Whats remarkable is that Blockbusters partner happens to be an energy 
company called Enron At a time when
so many oldeconomy companies seem helpless against the dizzying pace and 
technology of the digital age
Enron is demonstrating why FORTUNE magazine keeps voting it the most 
innovative large company in America
For years the Houstonbased firm simply produced transported and marketed 
natural gas Then as energy
deregulation threatened profit margins in the gas business Enron discovered 
it could make billions by trading and
brokering packages of energy the way Midwesterners do pork bellies Now Enron 
is moving into the
telecommunications business with a national fiberoptic cable network and a 
floor bulging with Sun
supercomputers

In fact Enron may be the most interesting oldeconomy company around Since 
moving its trading operations from
the phone to the Web eight months ago the company has doubled revenues to 
more than  billion Most of that
is made through trading everything from energy and paper to weather risk 
derivatives and now bandwidthmore than
 offerings in all Think of eBay but instead of auctioning  used Baby 
Gap pajamas the company trades
 blocks of natural gasand pockets commensurately huge commissions 
Boasts Enron president Jeffrey
Skilling In terms of dollars transacted were the worlds largest online 
site by a factor of  

So far this year that has meant  billion in transactions And when 
youre running the network all sorts of
profitable opportunities arise Last week when word spread that naturalgas 
prices would spike this winter Enrons
inhouse traders saw their gains surge as customers raced to lock in future 
supplies at todays prices And Enrons
stock price It hit  last week tripling its value of a year ago Kind of 
like an Internet play only better 

The market loves Enron because Skilling and CEO Kenneth Lay seem to have come 
up with a business model that
works for just about anything They provide a service to their customers by 
packaging a supply of name your
commodity and then using the efficiency of their vast network to beat most 
prices They arrived at this model back
in the mids almost out of desperation when crudeoil prices had 
collapsed naturalgas deregulation had
thrown that market into chaos and the Peruvian government had just 
nationalized Enrons offshore properties
Figuring they might as well leverage deregulation instead of succumbing to 
itcall it business judo Skilling a
McKinsey  Co consultant at the time came up with a plan called the Gas 
Bank to buy up reserves of natural
gas then package them for sale with various prices and conditions for 
different customers When electricity
markets deregulated a few years ago the company did the same Its the 
oldest concept in business buy low sell
high 

Enron also leverages its assets and expertise to provide services to big 
customers Since  companies like
Owens Corning and Chase Manhattan Bank have signed longterm 
multibilliondollar contracts with Enron
subsidiary Enron Energy Services EES that lock in their energy costs for up 
to  years and provide Enron with a
steady revenue stream Whats more Enron is beginning to actively manage its 
clients heating and cooling plants
installing new equipment when necessary and monitoring it all over the 
Internet 

Skillings latest gambit is to apply the same principles he learned in the 
power and energy sectors to making Enron
a leader in the booming telecommunications business The plan isnt to go 
head to head with established fiberoptic
carriers such as ATT Qwest and Williams Communications Instead Enron 
wants to use new switching
technology and its expertise in trading pipeline access to transform a modest 
telecom network into a powerful
arbiter of bandwidth Enrons bet is simple supply and demand will increase 
exponentially turning bandwidth into a
tradable commodity just like gas and electricity Along the way why not 
partner with companies such as
Blockbuster and use this new technology to offer contentlike movies and 
blow it through existing underutilized
pipe They are jump starting an application telecom content with a 
potential market of  billion a year says
Tom Nolle president of the telecom consulting firm CIMI 

Other neweconomy players are also beginning to see the power merchant as a 
prize partner IBM and AOL have
joined with Enron to form the New Power Co TNPC an independent startup 
that will offer pricing schemes and a
choice of power and gas service for residential and smallbusiness customers 
Enron provides the electricity AOL
enables customers to buy it via the Web and IBM takes care of the billing 
Its ludicrous that were in the st
century and you still have people jumping over fences to read meters says 
Skilling pointing out that the
technology exists to offer realtime pricing for gas and electricity In 
deregulated markets TNPC will allow
consumers to switch power companies as easily as they do phone companies 

Despite all Wall Streets enthusiasm for Enrons bold plans there are still 
plenty of skeptics Critics point out that
there is barely a market today for the companys bandwidth trading exchange 
They also stress that pushing digital
signals through pipe is a world away from routing natural gas Although there 
is plenty of cable across the country
carriers are not set up to mix and match access to it Its a very very 
difficult concept says Nolles Even the
Blockbuster venture is risky technology aside there is also the highly 
political question of digital rights How do
you satisfy Hollywood that its content is secure 

But Skilling and his lieutenants are quick to counter that everyone thought 
they were crazy to try to make markets
in gas and electricity And Enron after all is a company that thrives on 
entrepreneurial defiance of convention
Many of its new ventures were started because managers simply set new ideas 
in motion without waiting for
approval from the top Even the online operation was cobbled together in a 
mere seven months Skilling and Lay
found out about EnronOnline only two weeks before it went live 

Is taking risks really a part of a gaspipeline companys culture Just ask 
John Arnold the yearold chief of
naturalgas derivatives who after nine hours and  billion in trades last 
Wednesday had this to say You cant turn
away for a minute or you get picked off That has happened to too many 
traditional companies because they were
unable to find a niche in the new economy Enron however has traded its way 
into a starring role and now it
hopes it is ready for the movies

Subject Re pipeline aftermath  

Clayton

Here are some preliminary answers to your questions and I have copied GPG 
and Government Affairs folks as well to share this information  

  I am currently assessing the situation regarding pipeline safety 
legislation  This week has been very quiet on Capitol Hill as all of the 
members are back in the states on August recess running for reelection and 
it is a big vacation week for staffbut heres what I am hearing

As you may or may not know we have been been very active this year trying to 
temper pipeline safety legislation that was fairly reactionary in the wake of 
last summers liquid pipeline accident in Bellingham WA   

SENATE  In June Senators John McCain RAZ and Slade Gorton RWA led the 
charge to pass a pipeline safety bill S  out of the Senate Commerce 
Committee and that bill is awaiting floor action in the Senate   Because of 
the hasty way in which S  was drafted and passed there was a 
realization by both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate that the bill 
could not make it to the floor for a vote until some serious changes were 
made  mostly things that were deal breakers for industry  Enron and El 
Paso were leading the charge and we had a number of Senators backing our 
efforts to negotiate changes including Majority Leader Trent Lott RMS 
Kay Bailey Hutchison RTX John Breaux DLA and Sam Brownback RKS   
From what Ive learned since the accident these Senators are not changing 
their strategy and are still asking for the same improvements  Fortunately 
most of the changes we were looking to make were fairly technical and not the 
types of things that would be seriously compromised by the accident   
Industy was already in the position of having to accept a number of things 
they never would have if not for he Bellingham incidentthe El Paso 
incident just reinforces those   The biggest potential effect I see from the 
El Paso accident is an increased effort to pass something before the Congress 
adjourns in early October  The New Mexico Senators are already calling for a 
floor vote on the McCain Gorton legislation and I there will certainly be 
greater pressure on leaders to wrap up negotiations get agreement from all 
sides on a bill and move it unanimously through a vote on the Senate floor

HOUSE   The House is moving a bit more slowly but again Id expect the El 
Paso situation to expedite things somewhat  There were several bills 
introduced in the House that were not moving anywhere including an identical 
copy of the McCain legislation introduced by Rep Bob Franks RNJ  Franks 
is now anxious to move legislation as he is running for Senate and would 
love to take credit for helping out on an issue of national visibility   
Before the accident House Tranportation Committee leaders on both the 
Democrat and Republican side were working on a consensus bill that they 
could introduce in early September and move quickly through the Committee and 
to the House floor   Im told that negotiations on that legislation are 
moving forward and a draft bill will be produced shortly  Unlike our 
experience in the Senate we have had significant input into the bill in 
advance and expect something that we can live with  and something more 
reasonable than the McCain bill   With that said there may be an effort to 
expand the bill in a few areas because of the El Paso accident so well have 
to see what kind of hand were dealt in the next few weeks  

Overall Id expect pipeline safety legislation to be given higher priority 
when Congress returns after Labor Day  In the absence of this accident I 
would have given it slim odds of passing in the few short weeks until 
adjournment with appropriations bills taking up most of Congress precious 
time   Now there will be greater pressure to come to consensus and move 
bills through by an expedited process so that everyone running for election 
in November can show that theyve done something about this terrible 
tragedy   With that said theres still not that much time to get 
legislation through so Id say that theres still a chance it may not get 
done this year   If I had to attach a number to it Id say that the El Paso 
accident improves the chances of legislation going all the way to probably 


  Gas supply to California   Ill have to do some more checking in this 
area and get back to you   All Ive heard so far is that the safety 
questions that remain may slow the speed of restarting flow on the line 
notwithstanding that El Paso thinks it can have things running again fairly 
quickly   Im sure the power crunch in California will put some 
counterpressure on but I just dont have good intelligence on this yet

With all this said Im on vacation this week and parts of next week 
finishing up some leave Ive taken for the birth of our new baby daughter so 
I may not have an additional report for you until early to mid next week

If you have questions please respond by email or leave a message on my 
voice mail at 

Regards

Jeff Keeler

Hi Cynthia

The commercial officers here are very concerned with the El Paso pipeline 
explosion in New Mexico  We would love to get some input from your group on 
the following questions if possible

  What is the status of pipeline safety legislation on the Hill and what 
is the outlook for action between now and the end of the year

  What are people from California saying about the added pressure on gas 
supplies and what are people from New Mexico saying about restarting the 
flow of gas while safety questions remain

These questions come straight from the top and any information you could 
provide would be very helpful  Please write me back or call and let me know 
if when you think we might be able to get some initial answers

Thanks very much

Clay

2000-08-24T01:00:00-07:00,"I realize you have pushed these guys already but the attached letter would 
be better if not sent at all  It doesnt address the real underlying problem 
 that a reliability bill on a stand alone basis doesnt fix the problem  
Instead the letter implies that the reason for opposition is merely a 
political consideration  ie that it may reduce Congress appetite for 
action next year  If possible it would be better not to have the letter go 
out at all

Subject Re FERC INVESTIGATION IN CA  What should they be looking for  

Here are some more thoughts
FERC should take a hard look at why the ISO is almost always in an inc 
situation in real time  Without structural incentives to go short into real 
time I would expect the CAISO to inc in some hours and dec in others  
with no consistent patterns
The IOUs have four choices for purchasing power  PX Block Forward PX Day 
Ahead PX Day Of and CAISO Ex Post  They had ample opportunity to purchase 
lower cost power in the PX Block Forward but didnt buy enough  That left 
them short in the Day Ahead  They can reduce Day Ahead prices by moving some 
of their load to the Ex Post market  Dave Parquet did an Econ  
presentation on this incentive at the CAISO board meeting in June
The ISO remains primarily in inc mode even during the shoulder months when 
prices are lower another indicator that the real time inc problem is 
driven by the load side rather than the supply side  The IOUs continue to 
go short into the ISO Ex Post market even when the CAISO Ex Post price is 
consistently above the PX Day Ahead price
There is evidence that the IOUs are not willing to pay above the CAISO price 
cap for energy from the PX in the Day Ahead market  Does it matter that the 
price cap for the ISO also acts as a PX price cap
The NOx market in California is very tight  How has this contributed to 
higher costs and has the complete lack of available NOx credits prevented any 
generators from running
How large was the impact of the below normal water year on the supply side  
The attached presentation quantifies this effect in the Northwest  I have a 
theory on how hydro capacity completely overstates reserve margins in the 
west from an economic perspective  I can go into more detail if you wish
Friction between California PX and ISO markets and other western markets  
For example why are actual flows going into the state yet prices out side of 
the state are higher  Another example of anomylous behavior is at COB on 
  and    There was congestion from California TO the northwest those 
days in the Day Ahead market  In real time the NW ended up being a net 
seller of about  MW from the NW TO California
Demand Side  we really need to press on this issue because all of the 
proponents of price caps claim that as soon as the demand side is workably 
competitive then there is no need for price caps  Is largescale economic 
demand response required for a competitive market  What if demand response 
is there but at very high prices  The demand response in California is a 
joke  With  MW of interuptible why did the utilities and the CAISO only 
get around  MW of economic demand response  Much of this response comes 
at  MWh  The assymetric treatment of supply side resources and demand 
side resources can be justified on environmental grounds but not economic 
grounds  So why this assymetric treatment  This gets to the question of the 
fine line between scarcity rents which are ok and market power which is 
not  If power is scarce and demand truly values it at  MWh then 
shouldnt that be the price  At what price would the rest of the 
interuptible load economically curtail  Bottom line  there are about  
MW of load that should be able to respond to price signals that chooses not 
to or values power at more than  MWh
Burden of proof  what empirical measures should be used to assess market 
power  The reports published to date have been unimpressive  The Market 
Analysis Unit report for example does a bunch of handwaving and then 
concludes that there is market power  But they never explain why  I would 
think that proof might be something like this  Generator X sets price y of 
the time when loads exceed Z MWs  Or four generators set price  of the 
time when prices exceed  MWh  They have all the data to be able to tell 
yet they dont provide any empirical measures  The only test Ive heard of 
so far is the UC Energy Institute report that demonstrates that generators 
are submitting bids above their marginal cost  The PX report states that 
supply bids are fewer and at higher prices than last year  They fail to 
mention the fact that there are  fewer MW of hydro this year relative to 
last

Subject FERC INVESTIGATION IN CA  What should they be looking for

As we begin to meet with FERC Staff on the Wholesale market issues related to 
CA problems I think that we need to put together a list of questions that 
FERC needs to be asking Western power market participants  

The following are some questions that I think are important to have FERC ask 
Im sure there are more

 Were California utilities underscheduling load into the PX day ahead 
market  
 How many MWs did the CA ISO procure during each hour during the Summer 
  How does this compare with CA ISO procurement during 
 Has PGE changed its bidding behavior associated with its Hydro facilities 
in   
 Are there baseload facilities that were operated differently in  than 
in 
 Were any generation plants offline due to unplanned maintenance during 
Summer 
 How did the CA ISO demand side program work  Why didnt more load 
participate  
 What options did SDGE have to hedge its retail rates  What were prices 
in the CAL PX block forward market on Jan   and May  
 How high did natural gas prices go in California for generation during 
Summer 
 Were other Western power markets prices higher yearonyear
 Did the CA ISO Board face political pressure to reduce bid caps  Is this 
appropriate for a FERC jurisdictional entity
 What specific details is SDGE referring to in its Complaint on 
unworkably competitive CA ISO markets  Can these be fixed quickly

Please add other questions

schools but I think we should be pounding on the fact that market 
participants have been putting offers in front of sdge and that allowing the 
market to provide this solution is superior to legislated caps that require 
the creation of huge deferrals and more problems in the future

Subject Re Daily Update  Legislative activity      

I attended Cmmr Woods twoday hearing on Wholesale Markets which concluded 
today   in San Diego  Three Commissioners were present Wood Lynch 
and Neeper with Duque and Bilas participating by phone  Administrative Law 
Judge Wetzel was present and a transcript was taken  The quasilegislative 
hearing was the beginning of a record developed for the investigation into 
the workings of wholesale retail markets  This session focused on Wholesale 
markets  There will be subsequent sessions on retail issues market 
structure and other related issues in the future  My conclusion from this 
session is that Wood is looking for support for increasing regulatory 
intervention in the market

Dan Larcamp Director of the Office of markets Tariffs and Rates FERC was 
present  He relayed FERCs concern of this matter and a desire to hold 
hearings in San Diego  He also relayed that Hoecker held a press conference 
announcing the opening of a  investigative proceeding into the operation 
of the wholesale markets in California which carried with it refund 
authority

The format of the hearing was to respond to prefiled questions developed by 
Wood Lynch  Each member of the panel would respond to the questions and any 
questions posed by the Commissioners the Judge or the CPUC Attorney  No 
questions were posed by members of the audience  Yesterdays panel of 
academics were comprised of

  Dr Timothy DuaneUC Berkley
  Dr William HoganHarvard
  Dr Frank WolakStanford ISO Market Surveillance Committee
  David MarcusEnergy Consultant for the Coaltion of Utility Employees
  Dr Gene Coyle
  Dr JeanMichel Glachant Universite Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne

The panel was asked to speak as individuals and not on behalf of any 
institutions they may represent  While the purpose of the panel seemed to be 
to determine that market power was being exercised and that prices were too 
high and therefore not just and reasonable the panelist stopped short of 
blaming generators and market participants in behaving illegally  The 
concensus generally was that market power did exist at various times but the 
mere existence did not constitute bad behavior  None with the exception of 
Dr Wolak who is in the process of doing a study using recent data as part of 
his role for the Market Surveillance Committee had done a study  There was 
some discussion though not much of the monopsony power of the utilities  I 
think ultimately the group conceded that scarcity of supply amplified 
concerns about the exercise of market power as even the increase in gas 
costs did not fully explain the recent spikes  Wolak believes that encourage 
utilities to enter into forward purchases will reduce the exercise of 
realtime market power 

Hogan seemed to be there with Sempras interests in mind  He continued to 
promote expansion of the ISOs abilities to dispatch load as well as maintain 
system reliability  There was alot of discussion about forward purchase 
ability for utilities so as to be less subject to volatile market prices  
The concerns were also discussed about the appropriateness of a distribution 
utility making purchasing decisions on behalf of its customers  This 
included discussion of separation of these functions and the default provider 
role  

Most everyone agreed that rolling back to a regulated market was not feasible 
without raising other major and serious concerns however there seemed to be 
support for some interim measures where costofservice regulation may be a 
good idea and that was during peak periods  All agreed that a demand 
response and price signals are important in the longrun although not to 
the extent currently experienced in San Diego

Todays panel included representatives from SDGE SCE and PGE TURN UCAN 
and ORA  

While yesterdays panel maintained objectivity as to whether or not 
generators were exercising market power to the detriment of the system 
todays panel made no bones about the generators being to blame

SCE PGE indicated their need for relief for recovery of market costs in 
excess of the rate freeze  SDGE was still on the hot seat for their 
inaction in hedging any of their supply  SDGE brought up their failed PBR 
proposal and ORA and UCAN thought that that may be one way to incent the 
utility to be more responsible with their purchases

UCAN discussed the Governors direction and the potential for putting rate 
caps into affect for residential and small commercial  He mentioned that CI 
customers are experience difficulties as well  

TURN raised the need for costbased bid caps and costbased peaking 
contracts  Mike Florio TURN urged against any further divestitute of 
assets and alleged market concentration on those assets that had been 
divested  In fact TURN urged the Commission to seek legislation to clarify 
the Commissions authority to order retention of assets

Neeper urged that part of the solution should be changing the current 
requirement to use the PX as the only authorized exchange although TURN 
disagreed

Subject Daily Update  Legislative activity    

Siting related bills

 Good new  The Williamson Act passed the Senate  It should be heard 
at the assembly Saturday or Monday if it is not redirected to a Committee 
hearing

 There was a long meeting with Ducheny with regards to AB  The enviros 
boycotted they want to draft a bill with Keeley Labor was obstructionist  
they wanted to gut all the expediting siting  language with regards to all 
facilities except for the peaking plants  

Rate Cap related bills
 The Edison Language on Rate Stabilization may not go anywhere Edison has 
not found an author because of the efforts of Enron and others lobbying 
against it Furthermore there are signs that Gov Davis opposes it

 The Governors office has issued a proposed language for a rate cap bill 
The language however is not available as of yet It may be released today or 
tomorrow SDGE has shown concerns over the content of the bill They seem to 
think that it is worse than initially proposed by the Governor in his press 
release 
The bill includes retroactive rate caps through    
The rate cap could reflect Woods rate cap proposal  cts cap on the 
energy component
The bill does not specify who or how the costs associated with the cap will 
be recovered The reasoning is that UDCs will be more cautious in their 
procurement if there is uncertainty on who is responsible for the costs
All of this is speculative We hope to see the actual language soon

 Enron has been working with the Republican leadership to promote a rate 
cap proposal similar to the amended language we have proposed for AB
The bill focuses only on SDGE customers and our major principals are the 
following 
The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to residential and small commercial 
customers plus specific institutions that have a significant public role 
such as schools and hospitals  
The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to the period ending December  
The Interim Rate Cap must be structured so that any undercollection is 
eventually recovered from the same customers who benefit from the lower rates 
provided by the rate cap

Subject Ken Lay meeting with Japanese Prime Minister

Steve

Over the last month the Japanese regulators and Government have come to the 
realization that the electricity deregulation initiatives implemented in 
March of this year have not stimulated competition in the manner in which 
they had expected MITI and the Government are currently examining why the 
initiatives implemented in March are falling short of expectations and 
looking to move the  review forward to next year There are currently two 
multi party committees looking at the energy sector The ruling Liberal 
Democratic Party also has one committee looking at energy In addition MITI 
is in the process of forming a new advisory group comprising academics to 
consider the next stage of deregulation 

As you are aware we have been working the regulatory aspects through MITI 
and the US Government for some time now with a degree of success  in fact 
the majority of our  month goals have been achieved Recently with the 
addition of Kimura we have increased our level of contact with senior 
political figures in Japan

Both MITI and the USG continue to seek Enrons views on issues relating to 
the current deregulation process and the way Enron wants to see electricity 
deregulation We have recently addressed the parliamentary Deregulation 
Committee which reports to the Prime Minister and regularly provide 
educational presentations to MITI on issues relevant to deregulation 
Further senior political figures are now recognizing that Enron can assist 
in the deregulation process in a positive way

What we appear to have in Japan in the electricity sector is a reasonably 
clean slate and the opportunity to have a major say in how things should be 
structured in the future

Ken Lays links with the Republican Presidential campaign has received media 
attention in Japan and it is believed in Government circles here that he will 
receive a cabinet position if Gov Bush is elected As a result Mr Lay 
currently carries a great deal of weight in senior Government circles in 
Japan In the period prior to the Presidential election we have an ideal 
opportunity to get our message across at the highest levels of the Japanese 
Government through Mr Lay

A meeting between Mr Lay and Prime Minister and other senior Government 
members would significantly increase Enrons profile in Japan and assist in 
conveying our vision for the next phase of deregulation

If Mr Lay were to visit Japan possibly in late October or early November we 
would also look at coordinating the Tokyo office opening with the visit and 
arrange a number of high level commercial meetings Prime Minister Mori and 
the US Ambassador have already expressed an interest in attending the office 
opening 

Both Joe Hirl and I would like to speak with you further about the above 
When would be a convenient time

kind regards

Subject Black Mesa Pipeline Co
Cessna TUG Pipeline Patrol Aircraft

Fred below is the report from my chief of Maintenance regarding the Black 
Mesa aircraft

In a nut shell after reviewing this information I feel it would be 
appropriate to contract for this service  The liabilities associated with it 
are not worth it when you consider it can be done probably less than you are 
paying now by a local provider and receive the same results  
We would be more than happy to provide you with an approximate value for the 
aircraft and get you in touch with a broker to sell the TUG  
If you plan on continuing this operation with the Mesa owned aircraft I 
suggest you put the responsibility in the hands of an aviation contractor who 
will be ultimately responsible to Mesa not only with the upkeep of the 
aircraft services reports desired on patrol but also the contracting of 
flight crews
If you desire we will locate a contractor in Arizona to review the 
operation  I would expect the cost not to exceed  at the most  
Please call if you have any other questions or if you desire any additional 
help

Subject Black Mesa Pipeline Co
Cessna TUG Pipeline Patrol Aircraft

Gary
I spoke with a Mr Sil Perla pipeline patrol manager for Black Mesa Pipeline 
Co Tele   As follows

Aircraft     Cessna TUG Turbo Stationaire Six place single engine 
high wing aircraft
Hours    ACTT  Engine Time since new  hrs  PropTime since overhaul 
 hrs O H date unknown
Insp Program     hr inspections and Annual Inspections  Approximately 
two  hr inspections per year average  Last Annual inspection     
completed July 

 No maintenance performed inhouse  All maintenance performed at Arizona 
Aircraftsman Inc Presscott Arizona  This facility is a Certified Repair 
Sation and a Cessna factory authorized service center
 Maintenance is scheduled by the pilots  Mr Perla doesnt appear to get 
envolved in the scheduling of maintenance  I spoke with Mr John Aderholt at 
Arizona Aircraftsman Inc and he said that the pilots schedule and deliver 
the aircraft for maintenance  I asked how ADs and SBs were tracked and he 
seemed to feel that they werent  The only time ADs SBs were checked was 
when the aircraft was in the maintenance facility  Mr Perla said he was not 
familiar with Airworthiness Directives ADs and more or less confirmed 
this  Mr AderholtArizona Aircraftsman said the aircraft was in very good 
condition and that it was a low time aircraft  He said they did very 
thorough inspections and that Black Mesa usually didnt have a problem with 
any needed repairs
 The aircraft is used twice a month and flies a  mile trip at  feet 
above ground level VFR day only  The aircraft averages    hours per  
month  Mr Aderholt mentioned that the aircraft had flown  hours since the 
Annual inspection in July this year  They occasionally will have a passenger 
but he said this is rare  If someone wants to fly along the patrol the 
aircraft will stop and drop someone off at a plant etc but again this is 
rare
 He uses rental pilots for the patrols  Currently he only has two he 
uses  One has over  multi single time and the other has over  hours 
in a little of everything  The main goto pilot is a gentleman named Rick 
Olsen hes the   hr guy  Mr Perla said they both qualify for 
insurance purposes
 The pilots will review the maintenance logs for currency and accuracy and 
the repair invoices for discrepancies and action taken  Mr Perla didnt 
seem to get envolved in this  I further confirmed this through Arizona 
Aircraftsman that Mr Perla definately does not get envolved in the 
maintenance of the aircraft  He leaves it strictly to the pilots  There are 
only two repetative ADs on the airplane both due each  hrs

Summary Mr Perla said he has been with Black Mesa for two or three years 
and that he was fairly new at this  My impression is that he doesnt get 
envolved with the particulars of aviation and therefore doesnt really have 
much input as far as the actual operation and maintenance of the aircraft is 
concerned  The aircraft itself is probably in very good condition and is a 
very reliable workhorse that can endure its fair share of rough usage  
Although the aircraft is a simple and durable single engine aircraft and its 
operation is relatively easy  I believe it would be prudent to conduct a 
thorough review of the aircraft and records  And establish a stable base of 
operations that is familiar with the legalities and safe operation of a 
single engine aircraft  In my opinion it appears that no one is paying 
attention to the details
A few items in particular are
a The prop overhaul date is unkown  The factory recommends an overhaul each 
five years
b No one is responsible for ADs and SBs  Apparently they do not go to Mr 
Perla but to some other office
c Other details like ELT battery dates operation in accordance with FARs 
etc may not be monitered adequately
d Mr Perla mentioned that he is going to have some interior work and 
avionics upgrades next year  Assuming his limited knowledge of aviation 
what  assurances do we have of a legal and safe installation

Subject California Power Issues Database

We have developed an intranet site database for information tracking purposes 
for the California Power Issue The intranet site will be placed on the 
homeenroncom webpage by Tuesday morning for all Enron employees to access 
However today this comprehensive database is available to you for your 
California Power Issue needs 

The database has been populated with the latest information that I have 
received concerning this topic and has been broken down in three categories
California Power Issues National Power Issues and Secured Documents It has 
then been broken down further into subcategories

The secured documents sections will only be accessible to those that are 
receiving this email Please let me know if you believe others should have 
access to this information The secured document section contains all the 
information that I have received that Luntz Consulting has helped us develop 
ie principals statements speeches and facts as well as talking points 
and other statements developed internally These documents can be easily 
switched to open access to all Enron employees if you believe that these 
documents should not be restricted

To access the intranet site you must be logged on to the network and then go 
to this link  http  nahoulndevdcorpenroncom GovtAffansf  It is best 
if you copy this link and paste it in your internet Explorer or Netscape 
browser

Once you are at this site you will  be able to access all articles and 
information that I have collected received concerning the California Power 
Issue You can navigate the site by using the links on the left hand side of 
the screen While navigating this site keep in mind that the actual 
interface will be changed before we go live on Tuesday morning 

To access the secured documents click on secured documents and type in your 
user name which is the same as if you are logging onto the network and then 
type in your password which is the same as if you are logging onto the 
network However if you have difficulties entering this site you will need 
to change your Lotus internet password Which is very simple to do and which 
you will need to do regardless if you decide to use this site or not it is 
all part of the current computer migration To change your internet password 
go to this link  and then hit the edit person key Go to the last field that 
says internet password and type in whatever password you would like 
preferably your current network login password In the internet password 
section you will see a bunch of numbers and letters delete those and enter 
your new network password 

There are still some bugs that will be worked out by Tuesday but I thought 
since this is such a fast moving issue it was best to get this tool out so it 
could be used when needed If you have any questions please call me at

good arguments

   JAMES FLANIGAN Simple Steps May Ease SelfInflicted
 Electricity Woes
   Los Angeles Times  August    Return to Headlines


      Publication Date Friday August  
      Page C
      Los Angeles Times Home Edition
      Copyright    The Times Mirror Company
      By JAMES FLANIGAN

   Lets be clear the fact that the state botched the job of
 deregulation to begin with is one reason Californias electricity market
 is such a mess

   But failure to build a single new power plant in the state
 even as Californias economy expanded its use of electricity is the basic
 cause of todays shortages and soaring prices in San Diego Orange County
 and other areas

   Still some simple steps can be taken by regulators
 legislators and Gov Gray Davis to provide immediate relief

   The states major utilities should be free to buy power
 wherever they can get it They should not have to buy exclusively from the
 Power Exchange the Pasadenabased power pool that was set up by the 
 deregulation to achieve auctionbased prices for roughly  of the
 states electricity

   Approval should be expedited for adding smaller generating
 plants that supply power at times of peak demand That could alleviate a
 tight supplydemand situation over the next year or two while larger
 plants are built

   Long term the state needs to speed up the approval process
 for building new electricity plants The state also should force utilities
 to invest in the stillregulated system of power transmission lines which
 now has weaknesses in the San Diego and San Francisco areas

   Perhaps the most glaring fact about Californias electricity
 problem is how few companies have stepped up to supply power to this
 enormous market the nations biggest Only  or so suppliers including
 federal agencies the states own utilities municipal companies and
 private generating firms supply power to Californias system

   By contrast Pennsylvania which has an electricity market
 less than  the size of Californias has  separate suppliers of
 electricity today reports John Quain chairman of that states Public
 Utility Commission

   Its no coincidence that Pennsylvania has seen monthly
 electric bills drop  on average since deregulation Its worked out
 terrifically Quain says

   What did California do wrong It allowed the states major
 utilitiesPacific Gas  Electric Southern California Edison and San
 Diego Gas  Electricto recover  of their unrecovered or stranded
 costs for nuclear and hydroelectric plants and for past power purchase
 schemes mandated by the California legislature to encourage alternative
 sources of energy

   Then Californias legislators told the utilities to sell
 their conventional power plants to private generating companies all of
 which would sell their power to a central Power Exchange

   The California scheme was flawed at once overregulated and
 yet commercially clueless in not foreseeing trouble from a single power
 pool fed by only a handful of suppliers

   How did Pennsylvania do it It allowed the states utilities
 to recover no more than  of their stranded costs for nuclear
 plantsreasoning that company shareholders should accept some of the risk
 of their investments And rather than set up a central power exchange the
 state allowed its utilities and newcomers to the states electric system
 to compete for business

   Competition after all is what deregulation is supposed to
 encourage And competition is not happening in California

   It should be noted that the summer is relatively cool in the
 East this year and extraordinarily hot throughout the West All the
 Western states are suffering electricity problems Thats another reason
 for Californias trouble

   Normally  of Californias electricity comes from US
 and Canadian government systems and from utilities in Oregon and
 Washington Nevada and Arizona But this year because of lower
 hydroelectric supplies and higher demand from booming economies in those
 other states power for California is in shorter supply and more expensive
 when the state can get it Now there are accusations that some suppliers
 to California have taken advantage of their market leverage to extract
 premium prices for power

   Theres nothing illegal in angling for a better price or in
 using futures markets and other trading techniques as some generators may
 have done If any stepped over the line to illegal collusion federal and
 other investigations will determine the facts

   But who gave the generators the market leverage to exploit
 us The California regulators legislators and utilities did Told to sell
 their generating plants in  the utilities sold dozens of plants in
 package deals of two and three to single buyers They received premium
 prices from buyers such as AES Corp Duke Energy Southern Co Reliant
 Energy Dynegy and NRG The premiums were paid for the market leverage
 that multiple plants afforded the buyers

   Nobody in the utilities reckoned that they were handing
 market leverage to potential commercial adversaries Nobody in the
 Legislature or the regulatory staffs reckoned that the central Power
 Exchange could be held up by market leverage

   As outsiders often say about Californians Maybe its the
 sunshine makes them slow

Subject RED Index shows Texas NY and Maine advance on retreating 
Pennsylvania

Note to Steven Kean

The July Update to the Retail Energy Deregulation Index RED Index
published twice a year by the Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets
CAEM shows Texas Maine and New York are making the most measurable
strides in promoting sustainable competition among electricity providers as
customers throughout Pennsylvania retreat to their default providers due to
increasing wholesale prices

The RED Index which is the only known tool that objectively ranks states by
 attributes on how they are restructuring their power markets today
released the US rankings for all  states and the District of Columbia
in a  page report  Key results included
    Pennsylvania      
    Texas         
    New York         
    Maine         
    California         

These numbers underscore the importance of building a healthy foundation on
which electric competition can grow said Ken Malloy CEO of the Center

While Californias crisis has brought a lot of positive attention to
Pennsylvanias model many customers in the Keystone State are returning to
their original utility suppliers  It underscores how important it is to put
the right fundamentals in place if consumers and suppliers are to benefit
over the long haul Malloy said

In rankings that included all of North America the province of Alberta
actually would rank above all the states with a score of 

The midyear RED Index also found that  of states expressing an opinion
indicated that their commission is not less likely to take action on energy
restructuring as a result of the California crisis

CAEM is an independent nonprofit think tank based in Washington DC whose
mission is to promote an effective transition from the monopoly to the
competitive model of regulation

Ive spoken with Mary Joyce by phone and she has approved so I am requesting 
your approval as well  These people have basically been prevented from being 
able to reconcile any of the net pay accounts etc  for the past week

Please let me know if you will approve or if you need any additional 
information
Thanks

Subject Request for PR Access

Jo Ann
As we discussed I am sending this email to request PR Enterprise access 
reactivated for the following employees
  
   Karen Choyce               HR View Basic Data  Org ENTP
   Deana Taylor                HR View Basic Data  Org ENTP
   Joanne Cortez              HR View Basic Data  Org ENTP     starting in 
the group  
   Rebecca Tran               HR View Basic Data  Org ENTP      View 
Payroll and Time
   Roy Comeaux              HR View Basic Data  Org ENTP      View Payroll 
and Time
   George Howell              HR View Basic Data  Org ENTP      View 
Payroll and Time  

Please note I am not requesting access for the entire department  the list 
of employees above are the only individuals in our group that will be allowed 
this type of access Corps payroll accounting group is responsible for 
reconciling the general ledger balance sheet accounts across all Enron 
companies therefore Enterprise access is needed

The requested access is essential for our group to perform our job   Without 
this we are unable to trace amounts related to FIT FICA net pay stock 
option deductions etc  through the payroll system to the ledger and to 
ensure that the items are accounted for properly   Equally as important  
the access enables us to identify system issues between PR payroll and PR 
ledger   Corps payroll accounting group has already identified several 
processing issues and alerted the ISC   

I hope this pleads our case on why we need the access and request it be 
reactivated    Please feel free to call me or Mark Lindsey if you need 
additional information 

Thanks
Deana

 Subject     pm  Update Emergency 

 The situation continues to be stable CLHB has reinitated LPG operations to 
LaPaz but continue their inspection TR will not reinitiate gas or crude 
export operations until we have completed our inspection We have formed 
joint teams with CLHB and Army personnel to perform the inspection It could 
take as long as  hours but well have a better estimate after we get a 
progress report in the morning All crews available systemwide are 
mobilizing for inspection of the entire system but for now our priority 
continues to be the lines in the altiplano The three stations in the 
altiplano have been shut down bled off and locked Other supervisors 
throughout the system have been advised and are on alert

 Government and regulator continue to be supportive of our shutdown and 
inspection action plan We have developed a contingency plan with COBEE the 
regional electricity distributor under which they will redistribute energy 
out of spare capacity in Cochabamba to LaPaz  this should cover LaPazs 
electricity needs during the duration of time we need to complete our 
inspection The only other significant consumer is a large cement plant in 
LaPaz Weve agreed that they will slow down their operations and provide 
only small local supplies industrial concrete demand will be shutin

 We did not send a press release on the issue although we have received 
inquiries  our response is that we are concerned about the risk to Bolivians 
this action presented and we are performing an inspection on the system We 
are avoiding mention of gas stoppage to LaPaz at this time due to the 
volatility of the issue in LaPaz Government VMEH SIRESE has agreed with 
the message

 We expect that with the cement plant and power plant offline line pack 
should be sufficient to keep commercial demand satisfied for a few days In 
either event we are working with the local gas distributor to prepare a 
notice for LaPaz newspapers instructing gas consumers in the area how to 
safely shutdown and restart their equipment in the event that it becomes 
necessary

 The most likely scenario as of now is that Edwin Morales  a local 
revolutionary tied to the coca trade  is behind the action Morales has had 
contact in the past with the Raul Rocha bunch out of Chuquina Oruro so 
were still not sure whether this was an act against TR and or the industry 
or if it is against government Morales has just joined forces with another 
rebel out of Cochabamba and is planning nationwide road blocks for tomorrow 
Their agenda is national  theyve never isolated TR or our industry as a 
whole although Chaco in the north have been targeted in the past probably 
because they have a field in the middle of Morales stronghold The 
political situation here is tenuous with Banzer out and various political 
interests looking to fill the leadership void Were watching this situation 
closely The local Army brigade has committed to staying on vigilance for at 
least the next few days  once were comfortable with the operational 
situation well discuss a longerterm solution

 Subject Emergency 

   


 At  pm today a CLHB line walker discovered a bomb on their LPG line 
in the Altiplano  km from out SicaSica station Our OSSA II crude exports 
to Chile and GAA gas to LaPaz share the same ROW and would likely have 
been taken out with the bomb We understand that the bomb which had a 
manual fuse did not go off but had been lit and failed to explode The 
Army has been mobilized to diffuse the bomb and we consider the immediate 
threat neutralized

 However given that we have now seen several attempts in the last  days of 
sabotage against our lines I have declared a state of EMERGENCY and will 
notify the Enron Crisis team

 We have shut all Altiplano pipeline operations down and have mobilized a 
joint CLHB TR Army team to perform vigilance on the entire altiplano 
network The immediate result of this is that lights will likely start to go 
out in LaPaz within the next few hours  the GAA line is their primary power 
fuel supply Ive notified all relevant government authorities of the 
situation and so far am getting support Ive also asked the Embassy to 
look into the situation with the understanding that if this is the result of 
an organized movement they might have access to intelligence that could be 
helpful

 Additionally weve shut down all noncritical maintenance operations 
throughtout the rest of the system and are directing spare personnel to 
perform vigilance on the remainder of the system as quickly as possible 
Until and unless we have information that this threat goes beyond the 
altiplano we will continue operations with all stations on alert We will 
kick off the the total system inspection within the next few hours as soon 
as our people complete the overall plan

 I will keep you posted as things develop

Subject California Update 

The Senate the Assembly and the Governor are either poised to engage in very 
difficult negotiations or the three are about to crash and burn and Edisons 
going to be left dangling

In the Senate
The Senate bill XX is with about  likelihood going to be voted out of 
the Senate tonightwithout a vote having taking place in any committee
Burton announced during one of the two informational hearings that this is 
it despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the 
committees the bill likely wont prevent Edison from going bankrupt
The key features of the bill are
Banks and QFs get paid in full
Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers
No direct access
There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill 
tomorrow delinking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the 
Republicans will go along with it

In the Assembly
The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak with 
Hertzbergs the likely winner
That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions the 
amendments describing the conditions were faxed today
Were attempting to get the July  date changed to the effective date of 
the bill or later
The Assembly likely wont vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the 
earliest

The Problem
The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each 
approaches the problemin short the bills are two ships passing in the 
night
The Democratic leaders Governor Hertzberg Burton arent talking and 
Burton hasnt expressed any interest in talkingto anybody

The likely outcome given the circumstances  
Burton says hes done what he needs to do ie passed out a fair bill 
the Assembly and Senate cant agree they finish the budget time runs out 
they leave Friday and Edisons left twisting

That said theres still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit 
down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday or begin 
talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out  But given 
Burton the chance of that happening seems very slim

In short little has changed since yesterday

Best
Jeff

Subject California Power Issues Database

We have developed an intranet site database for information tracking purposes 
for the California Power Issue The intranet site will be placed on the 
homeenroncom webpage by Tuesday morning for all Enron employees to access 
However today this comprehensive database is available to you for your 
California Power Issue needs 

The database has been populated with the latest information that I have 
received concerning this topic and has been broken down in three categories
California Power Issues National Power Issues and Secured Documents It has 
then been broken down further into subcategories

The secured documents sections will only be accessible to those that are 
receiving this email Please let me know if you believe others should have 
access to this information The secured document section contains all the 
information that I have received that Luntz Consulting has helped us develop 
ie principals statements speeches and facts as well as talking points 
and other statements developed internally These documents can be easily 
switched to open access to all Enron employees if you believe that these 
documents should not be restricted

To access the intranet site you must be logged on to the network and then go 
to this link  http  nahoulndevdcorpenroncom GovtAffansf  It is best 
if you copy this link and paste it in your internet Explorer or Netscape 
browser

Once you are at this site you will  be able to access all articles and 
information that I have collected received concerning the California Power 
Issue You can navigate the site by using the links on the left hand side of 
the screen While navigating this site keep in mind that the actual 
interface will be changed before we go live on Tuesday morning 

To access the secured documents click on secured documents and type in your 
user name which is the same as if you are logging onto the network and then 
type in your password which is the same as if you are logging onto the 
network However if you have difficulties entering this site you will need 
to change your Lotus internet password Which is very simple to do and which 
you will need to do regardless if you decide to use this site or not it is 
all part of the current computer migration To change your internet password 
go to this link  and then hit the edit person key Go to the last field that 
says internet password and type in whatever password you would like 
preferably your current network login password In the internet password 
section you will see a bunch of numbers and letters delete those and enter 
your new network password 

There are still some bugs that will be worked out by Tuesday but I thought 
since this is such a fast moving issue it was best to get this tool out so it 
could be used when needed If you have any questions please call me at 


Thanks

Subject California Update

What people know

Hertzberg et als bill XXwas heard in an informational hearing today 
and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee  It will be heard again 
tomorrow perhaps beginning at  AM  at which time parties will have a 
chance to support oppose and ask for amendments  Most including us oppose 
unless significantly amended
The Wright D Richman R bill XXwas heard in an informational 
hearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee  It will be 
heard again tomorrow at which time parties will have a chance to 
support oppose and ask for amendments  From our perspective this is the 
best bill out there yet though it still has serious problemsit isnt 
available electronically yet but should be tomorrow and Ill distribute 
then  The chances of the joint DR bill being successful are slim however 
since its up against the Speakers competing bill  There is talk that the 
Speaker will try to negotiate with Wright Richman tonight and include any 
agreement in his bill XX
The original version of the Governors MOU bill sits in the Senate  Most 
believe that Burton will put it up for a vote this week and it will fail
The Senates version of the MOU SherPeaceKuehl XXcame out today  It 
will likely be heard in the committee tomorrow or the next day  Notably it 
kills Direct Access completely and makes Edison shareholders responsible for 
that portion of Edisons debt owed to suppliers  In short a very bad bill
Burtons XX which would delink the bond issuance to pay back the General 
Fund from the DWR contracts is likely to pass the Senate tomorrow or the 
next day  Manyincluding Enronsupport the bill though we are supporting 
it behind the scenes

What people dont know
Whether theres the time or the will in the Assembly and Senate to achieve by 
Friday a single comprehensive bill that can be sent to the governor for his 
signature 
Whether the Legislature would postpone its monthlong recess if the 
Legislature hasnt finished a bill by Friday most folks think they will not 
postpone
Whether its true that irrespective of the energy issue the Legislature 
will fail to get the budget completed by Friday and therefore have to 
postpone their recess anyway in which case they might continue to work on 
the energy legislation at the same time

Oddsmakers still say its better than  that the Legislature does not 
get the Edison bills done by Friday and leaves on on its day vacation

Steve

We have been approached by the Texas AM George Bush Presidential Library

Enron had made an original contribution to the library foundation back in 
 totaling K over five years

I am working with Community Relations and A A Recruiting to evaluate the 
latest request and to discuss where Enron may have interest or find leverage 
for our Government Affairs Recruiting or PR efforts

The Foundation is willing to work with us to establish whatever type of 
programs and or participatory involvement we would like  We have discussed 
an Enron speaker series classroom lectures advisory committee seats and the 
likes

I have already had a chance to run this by Rick Shapiro and Rob Bradley  
Although Rick was noncommittal regarding his teams time for speaking or 
lecturing he seemed supportive of the effort  Rob has already been 
participating in some speaking opportunities there and supported expanded 
efforts

What are your thoughts on contribution levels another K was suggested by 
CR and any specific program or relationship opportunities regarding the 
Library Center or School of Public Policy

Please grab me for quick conversation when you have time

Dear Jeff

Thank you for inviting me to participate in the energy policy forum event
in Washington DC on October   Ordinarily I would be happy to
participate  However my wife is scheduled to have hip surgery  on
October   Judging from the last time she went through this I will have to
stay around until she is out of the hospital and settled back at home
Accordingly I am not planning any travel before October   Too bad

On another matter can you ask someone in your energy services company to
get in touch with me  I would like to set something up with MITs
executive VP in charge of the business side of running MIT including
energy purchases and management  We have a  MW cogenerator buy gas and
electricity at wholesale and use lots of heating and cooling on an ever
growing campus with  students as many employees many computer
facilities and laboratories  Im sure that we can do it more efficiently
and I have been encouraging the management to look for opportunities to
outsource some or all of these activities  I would like to put them in
touch with someone at Enron

Wisconsin Gas to Purchase Nine Mile Line From Northern Natural Gas

Line Will Enhance Competition in Southeast Wisconsin and Use Existing 
Facilities 

MILWAUKEE July   PRNewswire   Wisconsin Gas Northern Natural Gas and 
Guardian Pipeline announced today that Wisconsin Gas has signed an agreement 
with Northern Natural Gas NNG to purchase a nine mile high pressure 
natural gas pipeline in Walworth and Waukesha counties The purchase price is 
 million The proposed transaction will require approval from federal and 
state regulators The pipe known as the Eagle line is located southeast of 
the Kettle Moraine Forest near Eagle Wis
The existing line has been part of the NNG interstate transmission system 
Under the new ownership the line will become part of the Wisconsin Gas 
distribution system and will interconnect with Guardian Pipeline as well as 
the NNG system 
Northern Natural Gas is pleased to be a part of a creative costeffective 
solution to provide additional gas service to southeastern Wisconsin said 
Dave Neubauer vice president of business development and marketing Northern 
Natural Gas This transaction enables Wisconsin Gas and its customers to 
obtain natural gas supplies from Guardian or NNG Providing reliable 
economical choices for consumers will benefit all of the parties involved 
We saw this as an opportunity to minimize environmental impact and still 
realize the benefits of increased competition in the natural gas market 
said James Schott senior vice president Wisconsin Gas The purchase of the 
Eagle line will enable Wisconsin Gas to further our goal of providing 
costefficient natural gas service to our customers 
As a result of the purchase Guardian Pipeline the mile interstate 
pipeline from Joliet Ill to Ixonia Wis will no longer build an mile 
lateral to Eagle The lateral was part of the originally certified Guardian 
Pipeline This portion of the line would have generally run parallel to the 
current Northern Natural pipeline 
This sale is a winwin situation for Guardian and consumers said George 
Hass project manager of Guardian Pipeline The Eagle line purchase by 
Wisconsin Gas saves Guardian time and resources by taking away the need to 
build the mile lateral and allows all three companies to create a better 
environment for competition in the natural gas marketplace 
The existing gate stations at LaGrange and Eagle will remain inservice for 
regulation purposes Odorization and measurement will take place at a new 
gate station that will be constructed at the interconnect with Guardian This 
new gate station will be called the Bluff Creek station and will be located 
near Whitewater The Bluff Creek gate station will be constructed during the 
construction of Guardian Pipeline 
Northern Natural Gas a subsidiary of Enron Corp with a market area 
capacity of about  Bcf d provides natural gas transportation services to 
utility customers in the upper Midwestern United States through its 
approximately  miles of pipeline

Commodities Review LME Copper Hit By Another Stock Rise
By Mark Long and Steve McGrath
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

  
Dow Jones Commodities Service
Copyright c  Dow Jones  Company Inc

LONDON Dow Jones Copper futures traded in London fell Friday as a 
further influx of stocks into official warehouses put the copper market under 
pressure and dragged down the rest of the base metal complex 
Threemonth copper traded on the London Metal Exchange ended  down from 
Thursdays late kerb close at  a metric ton
An increase of  tons of copper into LME warehouses Friday brought total 
stocks up to a month high of  tons This pressured prices in early 
trade down to test  ton support although prices recovered slightly in 
later trade 
Unconfirmed market talk said Enron is behind much of the weeks stock rise 
in an effort to ease nearby supply tightness and to alleviate the large short 
positions it is thought to have built up on the Julyforaweek spread which 
is currently showing a  ton backwardation The July futures contract 
will switch over to cash Monday 
Enron declined to comment on the market talk Friday 
A backwardation is a pricing structure in which deliveries to be made in the 
near future are more expensive then those set for a more distant delivery 
The opposite situation is called contango 
The spreads are still tight The major longs are still reluctant to lend 
with no signs of that tightness dissipated said Kevin Norrish an analyst 
with Barclays Capital in London 
Dealers and analysts said they expect further stock increases next week 
The entire base metals complex ignored Thursdays point rally in the Dow 
Jones Industrial Average dealers said 
Copper has been sensitive to moves in the stock market but not this time 
Norrish said In fact now it appears that base metals markets ignore 
equities markets when they rally but follow stocks down when they slump he 
added 
European Grain Futures See ProfitTaking But More Gains Expected 
European grain and oilseed futures were hit by a bout of profittaking and 
preweekend positionsquaring Friday after rising to longtime highs 
brokers said 
However world and domestic crop concerns the strength of the dollar and 
general bullish sentiment will carry the markets to fresh highs short term 
they said 
On the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange the 
benchmark November feed wheat contract ended just  pence up at GBP ton 
after hitting a new twoyear high of GBP ton in early trade 
Meanwhile Matif November rapeseed futures fell EUR on the day to 
EUR ton after hitting a threeyear high of EUR ton in early trade 
The UK wheat crop and the French rapeseed crop are forecast to be well down 
on last year and wheat and canola crops in some other major producing 
countries are also expected to fall 
Meanwhile the strength of the dollar is allowing European grain and oilseed 
traders to up prices and still remain competitive against US imports and 
dollardenominated grains on the world market

surged  percent to  p
The FTSE  finished  points or one percent firmer at  having 
jumped  percent on Thursday after seven consecutive losing sessions with 
gainers outnumbering losers by three to one 
Stocks steamed higher and refused to be derailed by sluggish US retail 
sales figures for June which showed only a meagre rise and a weaker Wall

By Londons  GMT finish the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was 
down five points while the techladen Nasdaq Composite Index was flat

Mike Lenhoff and Simon Rubinsohn at money managers Gerrard said that the UK

Drugs reversed an earlier decline with Nycomed Amersham among the days top

Futures Contract Covering Coal Debuts in New York Correct

     Corrects location of FirstEnergy Corp in th paragraph of
story that moved yesterday

     New York July  Bloomberg  The New York Mercantile
Exchange today began trading a futures contract for lowsulfur
coal a fuel that President George W Bush said will play a major
role in meeting electricity demand over the next two decades
     The contracts debut came after prices for coal considered
the dirtiest of powerplant fuels doubled in the past year as
demand from power plants outstripped mine production Coal for
September delivery opened at  a ton and settled at  as
 contracts were traded exchange officials said
     We had a big runup in coal prices this past winter said
Andy Ozley who buys coal for Atlantabased Mirant Corps six
coal plants in New York Illinois Maryland and Virginia This
contract affords us a way to mitigate our exposure to large
price swings
     The Bush administration said in an energy policy report this
spring that coal would be the dominant fuel for electricity
generation through  Bush gave an added boost to the fuel when
he retreated from a campaign pledge to restrict carbon dioxide
emissions implicated in global warming
     Coal plants are responsible for a third of the nations
carbon dioxide emissions They also produce sulfur dioxide which
causes acid rain and nitrogen oxides which cause smog
     The Nymex started the futures contract to give mining
companies and utilities a way to hedge their risks in the 
billion coal market Producers such as Peabody Energy Corp and
Arch Coal Inc whose shares have soared in the past year have
said they would trade the futures

                            New Plants

     Last years quadrupling of prices for natural gas  a
cleanerburning powerplant fuel  prompted many generators to
ramp up output from their coal plants Utility coal stockpiles
dwindled and prices have risen to their highest levels since at
least 
     So far this year more than a dozen companies have announced
plans to build coalfired plants including Kansas City Missouri
based Kansas City Power  Light Co and Portland Oregonbased
PacifiCorp
     Although coal is used to produce  percent of the nations
electricity few plants were built during the s because of the
high costs of building them and the difficulty of complying with
federal and local environmental regulations
     Demand for coal has eased in recent weeks as belownormal
temperatures in the US Midwest and Northeast reduced demand for
air conditioning said Jim Parks who buys coal for six power
plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania as director of fuels at Akron
Ohiobased FirstEnergy Corp
     The summers been pretty mild so far  you havent seen
any big heat waves in regions with the most coal generation he
said

                           Big Sandy

     The Nymex futures contract calls for the delivery of 
tons of lowsulfur coal to the mouth of the Big Sandy River near
Huntington West Virginia From there the fuel would be loaded
onto Ohio River barges and shipped to power plants in the US and
possibly Europe
     The new contract is tailored to producers in Appalachian
states that account for about  percent of US production
including West Virginia Kentucky and Pennsylvania the No  
and  coal producers
     The industry lacks a futures contract for coal from Western
states that account for  percent of the nations production
including the No  producer Wyoming

                         Avoiding the Past

     The exchange which earns commissions on trades hopes coal
futures will avoid the fate of other contracts it has started over
the past few years Its six electricity futures contracts have
fizzled as has its Middle East sour crude oil contract which
debuted in May 
     I said yesterday if you traded  to  contracts that
would be a really a good day said Chris Casale vice president
of energy trading at Dynegy Inc in Houston which trades coal and
buys the fuel for its six power plants in New York and Illinois
It came out sort of on target
     Most of todays trading was originated by large energy
marketing companies he said although he declined to say whether
Dynegy traded any contracts Enron Corp the largest energy
trader and Duke Energy Corp the largest USbased utility
holding company have said they would trade coal futures
     Exchange officials have said the coal market has the
potential to reach  trades a day after a year of trading
     The Nymexs yearold crude oil futures contract averages
about  trades a day and its yearold natural gas
contract averages about 

                           Wary of Coal

     The coal market is still lacking liquidity said Anthony
McAuley a floor broker at ABN Amro Inc who said he bought five
coal contracts for a client at  a ton  the markets first
transaction You probably need to see a little more
participation from industry coal buyers and sellers for the
market to take off
     Independent floor traders known as locals are wary of
trading coal futures without assurances that the industry will be
active as well
     Floor traders lost millions in electricity futures when
some were caught with highpriced contracts and nobody in the
industry to sell them to he said
     Because of that people are a little bit tentative about
coal said Tom Schiff an independent crude oil trader Were
here to help make liquidity but we cant tackle all the risk

		Giant energy concern now turns its attention to steel The companys 
aggressive posture has begged controversy Industry reactions vary from 
handwringing to open arms Still others characterize Enron as a nonevent
		By Michelle
Martinez Arjona
EditorinChief
and Paul Hohl
Contributing Editor
		
		These days saying the word Enron in a room full of metals executives is 
like screaming fire in a crowded theater For most in the steel industry 
the idea of a futures market is enough to raise a few eyebrows But when a 
major market maker with annual revenues of  times the market cap of the 
US steelmaking industry stakes a claim for  alone Enron logged 
revenues of  billionthats with a b a lot more than eyebrows are 
likely to be raised After a bold presentation from Jeff McMahon president 
and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets at the SSCI annual convention in May in 
which he accused steel mills of treating their service center customers as 
annoyances industry leaders rushed to understand this latest market 
contender 
		Friend or foe Competitor or partner These are just a couple of the 
questions surrounding Enrons aggressive push into the metals industry 
Judging from the service center and mill executives Modern Metals queried 
there are as many answers as there are opinions in the industry Reactions 
ranged from fear to acceptance to downright resentment At least one mill was 
reticent to discuss Enron at allstill others seemed to meet the issue with 
unaffected shrugs If the saying is true that all publicity is good 
publicity the buzz that Enron has generated would make even a Hollywood spin 
doctor envious
		Whats the hubbub
Although products such as natural gas and energyEnrons major business 
platformhave been traded as commodities for years until Enrons appearance 
a formal forward market for steel has never existed According to McMahon 
the absence of a liquid and transparent market has resulted in uninformed 
investment decisions that have exacerbated the current oversupply situation 
and left companies exposed to the hazards of price volatility 
		Enrons answer is to offer a variety of financial hedging products along with 
forward contracts in hotrolled coldrolled and galvanized plate and long 
products are soon to follow locking in prices for as many as five years 
out Enron contends that it can act as a risk intermediary in steel 
transactions ensuring healthier profit margins and lowering the cost of 
capital Certain grades of steel are commodities McMahon insists and as 
such should be bought and sold on a commodity market basis instead of the 
strategic relationships that now exist between the mills and consumers Enron 
has been offering steel online and via phone and fax since November of last 
year
		Before you add capacity before you make an investment decision youll be 
able to see a three five maybe even a year forward price of steel 
McMahon stated and if you want to hedge that investment you can do that
		The company plans to buy steel at a floating price and then sell it to steel 
consumers at a fixed rate making money on the spread In February Greg 
Hermans VP of steel trading at Enron reported to AMM that it was offering 
USmade gauge in wide hotrolled for April delivery in Chicago for 
 a ton Hermans said Enron was buying the same product for April delivery 
at  a ton 
		Eventually Enron sees the development of four different marketplaces the 
Northeast the Midwest or Chicago area the Gulf Coast or Houston area 
and the West Coast Enron will hedge against spot price spikes through equity 
and physical holdings in domestic mills The company closed on Huntcos 
Arkansasbased coldrolling mill in June
		Its a big portfolio McMahon said We wanted to put together a portfolio 
of supply and demand In some cases well own assetshopefully well own 
some term contracts with domestic mills To the extent that imports are a 
part of the equation well be a part of that market We may purchase 
capacity from somebody not necessarily the assets but toll slab through a 
hot strip mill All of those combined is how we do our business
		Steel mills can benefit McMahon said by entering into a multiyear 
physical off take with Enron thus giving steel mills a degree of certain 
volume and on product specification Enron would guarantee purchase of a 
specified amount of tonnage and use a floating price or a floor price to 
guard against market shocks Whether mills would be willing to divert 
capacity to the commodity grades being bought and sold by Enron remains 
uncertain At least one mill executive privately said no    at least for 
now
		Nucor president CEO and vice chairman Dan DiMicco also sees little value in 
Enrons proposal What we need to have is stable pricing at levels where the 
most efficient mills can make a good return on their capital and further 
invest in new technologies and equipment he stated I define true value as 
helping the industry to become stronger It doesnt do any good to maintain a 
lack of price volatility at  a ton
		Keith Busse CEO at Steel Dynamics echoed that sentiment in a recent New 
Steel article If youre trying to get volatility out at  per ton 
great he said But at  you want to stick your fingers down your 
throat
		For the service centers
Service centers McMahon suggested could benefit immediately The only way 
distributors are able to hedge themselves is to go out and buy inventory 
he explained That takes capital and cash and space We can offer a 
financial product that gives the exact same protection but doesnt require 
any of the above
		We can hold those inventories and price the steel at the time of delivery to 
the service centers he continued so their  or  percent net margins 
are somewhat certain
		I do think that Enron is providing a service for the industry     
commented Dave Lerman CEO of Steel Warehouse South Bend Indiana But he 
pointed out that how it moves forward will be interesting If they just 
move forward with hedge instruments    thats independent of whether you 
run your business well by having a good supplier that matches up with the 
demands of your customers I think Enron will be a good thing for some 
people and a nonevent for others
		Beyond hedging McMahon pointed out firm and enforceable contracts could 
become a key benefit to service centers As one Midwestern distributor source 
commented One of the terrible things that happens in our business is that 
end users demand longterm pricing beyond what anybody can foresee When 
they anticipate the market is going up or that it has hit a low point they 
push harder for itas any one would But historically they dont honor the 
deals 
		In a down market he explained customers demand lower prices Noncompliance 
can result in orders but no releases and a dont call us well call you 
attitude from customers The consequence for service centers he said are 
price reductions on the way down and on the way up If Enron brings 
integrity to both sides of this market he concluded that would be a very 
big plus for the steel industry
		But integrity another Midwest service center exec countered has got nothing 
to do with it In his estimation Enron is like a profiteering carpetbagger 
trying to make a buck in between the producer and the user Thats all we 
need right now he declared somebody trying to squeeze out a few more 
dollars But he recognized were all going to have to deal with it
		Don McNeeley president and CEO of Chicago Tube  Iron indicated that some 
good could come of a heavyhitter like Enron introducing new ideas into the 
industry but acknowledged that people might be offended by somebody picking 
the socalled lowhanging fruit of the steel market in the current economy 
What do you think the mills are going to do when you come to them for just 
the peripheral items he queried My concern would be that the price would 
go up on those items
		McNeeley also questioned the wisdom of distributors relinquishing control of 
their inventories In distribution  percent of our net worth is 
inventory  percent is accounts receivable and  percent is plant 
property and equipment he related Our single largest asset is our 
inventory If a distribution company surrenders control of its inventory to a 
third party does not that distributor in effect surrender its own 
sovereignty
		Only just begun
Questions abound regarding Enrons role as a physical supplier of steel as 
well As one Minnesotabased service center exec put it are they ready to 
deal with problems
		Although Enron has expressed interest in being a physical supplier Dave 
Lerman explained I think thats going to be a lot more difficult to 
implement Enron would have to consider specific qualities coil sizes 
nuances of chemistry surface quality and formability Most customers 
require better than standard tolerances he pointed out These are all 
issues that might complicate commodity sales
		Delivery is another issue As a physical supplier Enron has virtually 
guaranteed justintime delivery but as one service center source said the 
guarantee is good when the material shows up at my door What happens if it 
doesnt show up I disappoint a customer What good does it do to sue Enron 
if Ive lost a customer
		Mill executives have questioned whether Enron is a potential competitor 
They see Enron as someone likely to buy foreign steel in order to deliver it 
to a US customer said Chuck Bradford principal of Bradford Research and 
a longtime industry observer He cautioned against seeing Enron as too much 
of a physical supplier speculating that the future of Enron similar to the 
LME will be in hedging You may see some physical transactions to start 
with Bradford predicted just to get the ball rolling But I dont see 
that as the way the market will develop
		McMahon has been consistent in saying that Enron has little interest in 
becoming a steel manufacturer The real value he said is in a transparent 
liquid market We know the products work we know the market wants them Can 
any one particular mill or mills prevent that We dont think so he said 
Its not an if its a when
		The jury is still out on just how soon that when will come and what those 
effects will be for the steel industry And for all of the debate surrounding 
the issue it seems a bit soon to be hitting the panic button As Don 
McNeeley recounted I can recall similar controversy over a speech a guy 
gave about  years ago That guys name was Ken Iverson and he had this 
concept called a minimill Look at it now

I have one other thought we should discuss internally  Do we want to create 
a set of incentives for the management of PJM that would entitle management 
to incentive compensation to the extent they meet certain goals  eg 
relieving congestion on the grid increasing throughput across the 
transmission system expediting interconnection measured in terms of actual 
interconnections not just applications approved etc  This way we could 
create an organization that would have the incentive to make a workable and 
open transmission system

2001-07-09T02:56:00-07:00,"The letter looks good  A couple of comments for your consideration

On page three we describe the change to the definition of Public Utility and 
then argue that we dont fit into it  Would it be worth explaining why that 
makes sense  Specifically the New Jersey restructuring law like most 
efforts of its kind in other markets is designed to separate the competitive 
from monopoly elements of the power and gas businesses  Economic 
regulation would then be restricted to the remaining monopoly elements of the 
business eg distribution  The competitive market can not be solely relied 
upon to regulate the behavior of monopoly asset owners such as 
distribution utilities  Therefore regulators continue to be called upon to 
set pricing and other terms of service  What those regulators decide matters 
a great deal to those monopoly utilities and it consequently makes sense for 
lawmakers to be concerned about attempts by such entities to use campaign 
contributions to tacitly influence decision makers  The same public policies 
simply do not apply to that portion of the market which is competitive  The 
generation and sales business has a competitive structure ie relatively 
low barriers to entry multiple competitors etc  These components of the 
power and gas business can be regulated by the market with respect to rates 
and terms of service  They do not require economic regulation any more than 
grocery stores department stores appliance sellers or other retailers 
who presumably are not prohibited from making contributions  Competition 
and markets discipline behavior and establish competitive prices and terms of 
service  Because regulators dont set the prices and terms of service for 
such sellers there is no reason to be concerned about campaign 
contribuitions from such organizations  Indeed the legislation and the 
legislative history clearly conform to this underlying policy rationale
As a former practicing lawyer I certainly understand the value of pleading 
in the alternative  But I question how certain of our arguments woud be 
perceived by the public if they ever came to light which these documents 
have a habit of doing   I can just see the press seizing on Enrons claim 
of ignorance or mistake or the fact that we pled for the favorable exercise 
of prosecutorial discretion  I suggest that we add whatever we feel is 
necessary to the very solid looking intent argument not make specific 
reference to ignorance or mistake and not plead for the favorable 
esxercise of PD  If we feel we need to write about this last item perhaps 
we could suggest that it would be a waste of the publics resources to pursue 
a claim under such circumstances"

Subject Transatlantic meetings

To the Executive Committee

Attached is a note that has been sent to our managers regarding offsite and 
teambuilding meetings  My impression is that our commendable efforts to 
build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many gettogethers that 
require substantial travel  Our challenge is that such gatherings are far 
more costly and timeconsuming for us to attend than our Houston colleagues 
might realize  Often participating in these meetings takes an entire week 
for Enron Europe employees especially if they are outside of Texas 
Naturally they may feel that this time of year PRC time is exactly the 
wrong time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering

These offsites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter which 
compounds the difficulty worse still are the times they occur at the end of 
Q since it also coincides and conflicts with the PRC process

I would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the 
travel time and costs both direct and indirect when inviting international 
employees to offsite meetings in the US  We appreciate the chance to be 
included in the broader Enron initiatives and to share ideas across 
organizations but we are really trying to reinforce the message about 
managing expenses

Thanks

John Sherriff


Letter sent to all Enron Europe VPs and direct reports

We still have issues regarding Offsites and Team Building exercises  In 
particular we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform 
other key work groups when workplace absences are pending

In order to avoid misunderstandings and to increase transparency the 
following will apply with immediate effect

Any Offsite or Team Building exercise which any group both commercial and 
noncommercial and including John and myselfintends to undertake must be 
communicated in advance to all department heads Issue to be identified 
include  all participants who will out of the office total costs of the 
exercise and where appropriate work load coverage details

John and I are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefer 
that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends To the extent that is 
not possible we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work is 
appropriately covered

Trips to Houston and especially resorts in the US are far more difficult to 
justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved  So please 
pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel

Please communicate this policy to your staff

Federal price limits backfire 
Some generators withhold power rather than abide by rate caps 
David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer
Wednesday July   
 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL 
http  wwwsfgatecom cgibin articlecgifile chronicle archive    M
NDTL 
Officials in California and Nevada after months of lobbying for federal 
regulators to cap Western power prices warned yesterday that the newly 
imposed limits have had the unintended consequence of increasing a threat of 
blackouts in the two states 
The warnings were issued as California came within minutes of rolling 
blackouts yesterday afternoon and one day after the firstever rolling 
blackouts in Las Vegas forced energyhungry casinos to shut off fountains and 
reduce air conditioning 
The two states are asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take a 
closer look at the socalled price mitigation plan and come up with revisions 
that would deter power companies from withholding electricity during 
shortages 
We need some clarity to this order said Oscar Hidalgo a spokesman for the 
California Department of Water Resources which is spending billions of 
dollars to keep the states lights on 
Generators need to be held accountable he said 
The crux of the problem is that price limits kick in during shortages yet 
power companies say these caps force them to sell power at belowmarket rates 
during periods of high demand 
Some companies have responded by holding back power rather than face the 
expense of shipping electricity from state to state Each mile that 
electricity must be transmitted adds to the overall cost 
No ones going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps said 
Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum an 
energyindustry association in Menlo Park 
Ackerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was no 
economic advantage to offering power in regional markets when price controls 
are in effect 
This means individual regions like California or Las Vegas could end up not 
having enough Ackerman said It increases the threat of blackouts 
BLACKOUT ALERT CANCELED
California authorities issued a blackout alert at  pm yesterday when 
power reserves dipped to dangerously low levels They canceled the alert 
about an hour later after finding additional supplies 
Everyone in the West is fighting for megawatts said Stephanie McCorkle a 
spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator which oversees 
the states power network 
The Golden States latest brush with lightsout conditions came a day after 
Nevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time prompting 
heavy power users such as the MGM Grand and Caesars Palace to dim their 
lights 
Don Soderberg chairman of the Nevada Public Utilities Commission said that 
the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that they 
are investigating to see what role the federal price limits may have had in 
exacerbating Mondays shortage 
Were looking very closely at this he said There seems to be a potential 
for unintended consequences 
Specifically Soderberg said Nevada is focusing on operators of older less 
efficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking if not vanishing 
under capped prices 
Were going to see how the caps might have played into this he said 
The federal ceiling in  Western states excluding California is about  
per megawatt hour In California a  percent surcharge is added because of 
the states credit risk bringing the price to just over  
Ackerman at the Western Power Trading Forum said regional price controls have 
extended Californias power crisis to neighboring states 
California sneezed and the rest of the region caught the virus he said 
LAWYERS LOOKING FOR LOOPHOLES 
California and Nevada officials however said that they still have faith 
that price limits can stabilize Western electricity markets but that federal 
regulators may have to tweak the system so that power companies cannot 
withhold output 
The generators have banks of lawyers looking for loopholes in the plan 
said Hidalgo at the Department of Water Resources 
Unfortunately it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue 
that they took up only with the greatest reluctance For months federal 
regulators refused to impose price controls preferring instead to let supply 
and demand determine costs 
Hidalgo said that when it appeared that power companies were throttling back 
on output Monday California officials immediately dialed the hot line number 
provided by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in case of emergencies 
No one answered he said They were closed 
State officials tried again yesterday and this time were told that the 
commission would look into the matter They were not given a time frame for 
when the commission might come up with a response

Outofstate generators pull plug over uncertainty on price controls
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
Published July   
Confused by the federal governments new controls on electricity prices 
generators withheld so much power from California on Monday that the state 
was nearly plunged into rolling blackouts state officials said 
The confusion began when the states electric grid operators declared a Stage 
 power alert in the early afternoon triggering the price caps for the first 
time since they went into effect June  
Outofstate generators pulled about  megawatts of electricity off the 
table at midafternoon enough to power about  million homes because of 
uncertainty about how much they could charge under the new Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission pricing system said Oscar Hidalgo spokesperson for 
the state Department of Water Resources The department buys electricity for 
the states financially distressed utilities 
They didnt understand what they were going to be paid there was confusion 
over the FERC order Hidalgo said We saw  megawatts disappear 
The problem was exacerbated by a heat wave across the West which forced 
California to compete with other states for scarce electricity he said 
Rolling blackouts hit southern Nevada 
Most California officials credit the FERC system which is based on a 
variable price cap with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power 
market But power generators have complained that the price caps by limiting 
profits could discourage the production of critically needed electricity 
And as Mondays episode suggested even the uncertainty about where the cap 
will fall could lead to unexpected shortages 
Thats the risk that you run with price controls said Arthur ODonnell 
editor of the newsletter California Energy Markets People want any kind of 
certainty at all 
Hidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of lastminute imports 
from the Bonneville Power Administration the federal agency that markets 
governmentproduced hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest The state 
went into a Stage  power alert the nexttolast level before blackouts are 
ordered The alert was canceled in late afternoon 
The blackouts would have been the first in California since May  
FERC imposed a roundtheclock ceiling on power throughout the West The 
price fluctuates and is tied to the production costs of the leastefficient 
plant operating in California during a power alert declared by the 
Independent System Operator which runs the states powertransmission grid 
When theres no alert prices cant exceed  percent of the cap that was 
established during the latest alert 
Until Monday the maximum price held steady at about  a megawatthour in 
California But when the ISO declared a Stage  power alert in early 
afternoon signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than  
percent of demand confusion set in Hidalgo and others said 
Because of a steep drop in the price of natural gas which fuels many 
California power plants suppliers knew the cap would fall But no one knew 
by how much until the price was posted by the ISO 
The ceiling for California fell to about  at  pm but was back up to  
in two hours according to the ISO Those prices include the  percent 
premium that sellers can charge California because FERC said theres a credit 
risk in selling to the state 
ODonnell said its likely suppliers will pull back from the market every 
time the ISO declares a power alert 
Instate generators have to operate their plants if summoned by the ISO But 
outofstate suppliers can withhold supplies and on Monday it was the 
outofstaters that were pulling back Hidalgo said

Power Sales Halted by New Pricing Curbs 
Electricity Confused suppliers unsure what they will be paid refuse to 
sell to state which asks FERC for a ruling but doesnt get it 

By NANCY VOGEL Times Staff Writer 

SACRAMENTOConfusion over new federal price restrictions prompted 
several electricity sellers to back away from sales to California on Monday 
afternoon pushing the state closer to blackouts energy officials said
The state lost sales that would have provided enough electricity to 
supply more than  million homes said Ray Hart deputy director of the 
California Department of Water Resources which has been buying much of the 
states electricity since January
At least five companies producing or marketing power are telling us 
that since they dont know what theyre going to get paid theyre not going 
to take the risk and so theyre not going to sell the energy Hart said
The electricity sales fell through after power consumption soared in 
summer heat and grid operators were forced to declare a Stage  emergency 
meaning reserves had dipped below  It was the first such emergency since 
May 
Under a June  order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
intended to bring down wholesale electricity markets across the West a power 
emergency in California triggers the setting of a new price limit that 
applies to power plant owners from Washington to Arizona 
The new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run the 
most inefficient expensive power plant selling electricity to California 
grid operators during the first full hour of a Stage  emergency
But much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price is 
supposed to be established under the commissions order and that apparently 
drove away sellers Hart said
Shortly after the state issued the Stage  alert at  pm putting 
the old price limit of  per megawatthour in question companies that had 
committed to provide the state electricity hour by hour Monday afternoon 
backed out Hart said The companies include TransAlta Energy Marketing of 
Oregon Constellation Power of Baltimore and Sempra Energy Trading a unit of 
the San Diegobased energy conglomerate
Forced to dip even deeper into the states power reserves and declare a 
Stage  emergency water agency officials called the federal energy 
commissions hotline for clarification about what the new price should be and 
when it should take effect They got no answer
Hart said commission officials reached at home promised to try to 
clarify their order today One outstanding question is what obligations power 
suppliers have to deliver electricity to California in an emergency
Both buyers and sellers in the market agree that the new price when it 
is set will probably be lower than  per megawatthour because the price 
of natural gas the main fuel in California power plants has dropped lately
Temperatures soared several degrees higher Monday than grid operators 
had anticipated But they said they expected to avoid rolling blackouts in 
part because the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland Ore had 
agreed to provide several hundred megawatts of Pacific Northwest hydropower 
each hour in exchange for a return of electricity from California later this 
summer
Bonneville is giving us emergency power to get us through Hart said

Subject Dedicated eSpeak Room

Steve and Mark

eSpeak is gaining tremendous momentum to become the communication vehicle for 
Enrons business units In the first quarter of  we estimate at least 
one eSpeak session per week  and growing  Jeff and Joe have personally 
committed to an Office of the Chairman eSpeak event every two weeks  Cliff 
Baxter Cindy Olson and Tom Gros are scheduled for January events  We are in 
the process of scheduling Ken Lay Ken Rice Kevin Hannon Marty Sunde and 
Joe Hillings

As eSpeak events currently take place in different locations there is an 
incredible amount of time and energy required to set up and test the 
equipment and infrastructure for each event  It is crucial to have a 
dedicated eSpeak room  Preferably this room should be on the th floor 
where the eThink team can train executives in advance and conduct each eSpeak 
session  The ideal and most efficient scenario would be to set up the 
equipment four terminals in an office space on  where the equipment will 
be secure and the Public Affairs group can still use the office as extra work 
space

We request your authorization to move forward  As we are moving into new 
space this is the perfect time to dedicate a room

Please feel free to call me at x or Marie at x

Subject Can you help me

I am looking for some help in identifying the right persons at Enron
Corp for an introduction of our software solution  Steven if you could
take a moment and point me to the appropriate contact I would greatly
appreciate it

Summary of eProvisioning
 
eProvisioning radically improves peoples TimeToProductivity by
transforming the disparate activities that allocate IT resources to people
into a secure and automatic process Once provisioned these resources
remain digitally connected to each person as they move through the business
cycle and are dynamically updated as necessary At the appropriate time
they are systematically securely and automatically removed  

Organizations that employ eProvisioning gain a competitive edge and access
complete security by ensuring that people are kept productive from day one
and are prevented from becoming counterproductive beyond the day they leave
In addition by aligning their IT infrastructure with business priorities
organizations can effectively manage change across the extended enterprise
and better respond to emerging market requirements 

eProvision Day One provides business and IT executives with the ability to
quickly identify bottlenecks and maintain accountability of the
eProvisioning process through comprehensive reporting and tracking
capabilities As business relationships between organizations expand
Business Layers technology provides the framework for integration and
interoperability between eProvisioning partners  suppliers and service
providers devices and applications  which are the digital foundations of
the Internet economy 

Please if you could give me a few minutes of your valuable time or guide me
to the right person to describe the significant benefits of what we offer

Have you had a chance to look at the book Funky Business and to give any

have a thousand other things on your plate not the least of which is 
California so I understand if the answer is no  However theyve been

Id seen an article in Fortune several months ago titled Managing for the 
Slowdown  It talked about new challenges managers face in light of the 
economic downturn  Most young managers have never experienced anything but 
boom times  The article also outlines a dozen or so things companies should 
be thinking about now  Use the downturn as a new opportunity to evaluate 
people  Overhaul your budget process  Dont stop communicating etc  I 
think it would be beneficial to address similar strategies and ideas with our

2000-08-29T04:38:00-07:00,"Im looking forward to your discussion regarding the reregulation threat at 
the next meeting  Below are some of my observations

While its premature to say we have an energy crisis we are witnessing the 
triple threat of high summer gasoline prices spiking electricity prices and 
high natural gas prices for the upcoming heating season Ill send along some 
of the data
There is at least the potential for this to become a prominent national 
political issue  Gore has focussed relentlessly on Bushs ties to big oil 
which includes us by the way though we produce nary a drop and 
Congressional republicans have blamed the current administration for failing 
to have a coherent energy policy though at least so far the dominant 
characteristic of the administrations policy has been a republicanesque 
reliance on the market  
Notwithstanding the issues potential to become political fodder and its 
prominence in the popular press many Americans seem blissfully ignorant at 
least on the electricity issue  We did some focus group testing recently in 
Southern California  a mere  minutes from the epicenter of the San Diego 
price quakes  and most people knew nothing about it  So while the issue 
has the potential for political traction it may not have caught on yet 
except in places like San Diego and New York city
The reaction in California has been to call for government intervention in 
electricity markets  Investigations of out of state price gougers and 
profiteers have been undertaken and wholesale and retail price caps have 
been put in place  They have not worked  at least in wholesale markets  
Suppliers are deciding to site plants elsewhere and when prices are high 
elsewhere in the West power flows out of California to those other markets  
Ironically though I cant explain it in classical economic terms the 
setting of rate caps in wholesale markets has had the effect of pulling 
prices up to the capped levels in offpeak times when there is more than 
enough supply  For the most part though the caps and the other political 
reactions have been somewhat muted policy makers have been reluctant to 
throw the deregulation plan out and start over and the retail price caps 
have been relatively narrow  so far
Outside of California the authors of other states deregulation plans have 
distinguished their proposals from Californias  Regulators and legislators 
from such diverse places as Connecticut Texas and Alberta have gone out of 
their way to defend their plans and explain why California wont happen 
here  For the most part then the reaction to California has been positive 
from Enrons perspective in states that have already deregulated  There does 
remain some threat that aspects of the state plans eg utility plant 
divestiture may be postponed or cancelled  The story is a bit more grim in 
states that were considering deregulation but have not gone forward with 
their plans  I think its off the agenda in most places  The fact that most 
of the major markets about  of total electric revenue are already 
deregulated deregulating is a blessing in that regard
At the federal level there has been a combination of the burn the village in 
order to save it approach   allow some price caps to remove the pressure 
to reverse the whole deregulation program  and a more positive call for 
comprehensive reform
All in all I believe were OK so far and we need to look at this as an 
opportunity  business is booming  we sell protection from price volatility 
and the need for such protection is now plastered over the front pages of 
major newspapers  On the public policy front we need to convert the 
controversy into productive action  Our target has been FERC  they are 
somewhat removed from the white hot rhetoric in California and they are a 
single commissioners vote away from taking action to further open the 
market
Enrons response  Initially we hoped to feed information into industry 
groups and let them carry the message our concern was that Enron  a 
company which was in and out of the residential market in Cal  would not 
make the most attractive champion for the open market message  We hoped that 
the new generators in Cal would take up the mantle  Its fair to say that 
they fumbled the ball  they are now locked in a pitched battle with the 
utilities over price caps and fall all to easily into the out of state 
profiteer label  standing between Aunt Millie and rate relief  They were 
also extremely slow out of the blocks with a more productive message  We are 
now working the issue directly  We are working the issue on a number of 
levels  PR  we have good contacts in the press and have talked to 
numerous reporters and editorial writers  As time goes on the information 
and reporting has gotten somewhat better    Govt relations  we have been 
pushing for power plant siting legislation in California the market wants to 
build capacity but the government wont let it  This may be the best 
environment well ever see for streamlining the permitting process  Also in 
typical Enron fashion we put a deal on the table  We offered to sell power 
to the local utility at a price which would enable them to lock in stable 
rates for their customers at below current rates  Our offer was followed by 
nine others and we tried to make something of the fact that the market was 
offering better solutions than California politicians  SDGE dropped the 
ball unfortunately  Instead of seizing the opportunity they ended up going 
along with a government granted rate discount which will cause them to accrue 
a massive deferral account  At the federal level we are contacting members 
the DOE and FERC  Here we are making a push for FERC action to finish 
leveling the playing field in wholesale markets so power can get from where 
it is to where its needed  Additionally we are developing a prepackaged 
system including software for nondiscriminatory open access to take away 
any lingering excuses or delays   Overall messaging  we have been 
working with a well known political pollster to check our messages for their 
resonance at the grassroots level  As we hone these messages we will be 
using them in the fora we are currently working
Overall we have more opportunity than risk in the current environment but 
capitalizing on those opportunities continues to be a long shot
An intersting rhetorical challenge for us is this  much of the problem in 
power markets is blamed on high upstream fuel prices particularly natural 
gas  The gas market is open and structured pretty much the way we are 
advocating for electricity so how can we maintain that the problem in power 
markets is an absence of open markets when the most open commodity market on 
the planet natural gas is producing such outsized prices  The answer is 
somewhat complicated and therefore a bit unsatisfactory in the current 
debate  gas prices are still lower in real terms than they were 
prederegulation  long term prices are also lower than historical levels  
the curve is backwardated sp meaning that prices in later years are 
lower than today so you can buy gas for  years at a price lower than current 
spot prices and the economy is booming and driving up demand for basic 
inputs this begs the question why didnt the market react sooner and avoid 
the spike  When all else fails a big part of the problem can be blamed on 
OPEC  We havent had this thrown at us yet but we are trying to anticipate 
it and have answers at the ready

 This is just the tip of the iceberg  The issue is a great example of the 
intersection of our business interests with public policy debates and should 
promote a lively discussion when we get together  Let me know if there is 
anything else you need"

Subject Highlands Forum Wrapup

Dear Steve  just a brief note to say thank you again for your excellent
presentation at last weeks Highlands Forum  I believe that your remarks
along with those of Goran Lindahl Dick Foster and Phil Condit of Boeing
have caused a significant stir in the preparation for the congressionally
mandated Quadrennial Defense Review and the Secretarys transformation
planning  I also can tell you that the feedback from participants regarding
your briefing has been terrific

We are reviewing all the material this week to begin the process of
recreating the session on the Secretarys webpage for the Forum and I will
be going over the video and audio clips for posting  Recognizing that your
slides were proprietary it would be most valuable if we could post as much
of your powerpoint briefing as possiblewhatever you feel comfortable with
sharing  Whatever that turns out to be if your staff could email that to
me I will make sure that only that and not the original that you sent to
me gets posted

I am not sure where the senior leadership of the DoD will be going in the
coming months however I know that the discussion of your experience at
Enron and the experiences of your panel mates will have an influence

A more formal letter of thanks will be forthcoming but for now thank you
again for joining us and helping to make this a memorable and most important
Highlands Forum

Best regards Dick

Ken Lay Visit Balancing the need to push out the arrangement of high level 
meetings as far as possible with the desire to have a meeting with Prime 
Minister Mori prior to the US Presidential election the week commencing  
October would be the optimum time for a visit by Mr Lay PM Mori is generally 
available in that week We will get a preferred time from the PMs chief 
secretary first thing tomorrow morning Tokyo time 

Jeff Skilling Visit The boards of Nikkei and Tokyo University Institute of

one day invitation only seminar to be held on  October As mentioned the 
boards will choose between the chairman of Cisco and Jeff Skilling The 
conference is focused on the IT revolution and an invitation only event for 
approximately  of Japans corporate leaders

The speaking panel and topics for discussion will be developed around the key 
note speaker If Mr Skilling were to give the key note speech it is likely 
that key senior Government Ministers would be asked to present at the 
seminar 

Following the Prime Ministers commitment at the Okinawa summit of 
USbillion expenditure in the region on IT infrastructure and education 
Japans focus on ecommerce is almost reaching fever pitch There will be 
significant interest in the conference from senior levels of Government and

Subject White House To Support FERC Action Today

According to this mornings Washington Post the Bush Administration will 
support the expected FERC action today of extending the existing California 
price mitigation regime to  other Western states and to all days all hours 
not just during California emergencies stages   and   This action 
comes only a day before FERC and other witnesses will  testify on the 
Feinstein Smith price cap legislation before the Senate Energy Committee 
Gov Davis and FERC will  testify before the Senate Governmental Affairs 
Committee on Wednesday and the House Financial Services Committee joins the 
fray with a hearing on the California energy situation on Wednesday  The 
latter committee will probably base its jurisdiction over some aspect of 
energy policy on a number of factors including its jurisdiction over 
presidential economic emergency powers  The committee staff has in the past 
expressed interest in derivatives and other financial aspects of energy 
trading and markets  We are checking now to quietly determine whether these 
issues will be on Wednesdays agenda

approach  If not we are going to roll out this change effective close of 
business tomorrow

Steve Cindy Id suggest that we simply make this change tomorrow  Do you 
feel the need to run it by any of the policy committee beforehand

Subject RE Clickathome  Proposed treatment for Involuntary Terminations  
Business Reorganizations

Suzanne

It is my understanding that everyone is signed off on the suggested revisions 
to the Clickathome documents relating to redeployed individuals   Tax is

In summary if a person is terminated from Enron or one of its subsidiaries 
as a result of a business reorganization the forfeiture penalty is waived  
The amount of the waived forfeiture penalty is added to that individuals 
income as salary imputed income and is subject to Federal State and FICA 
taxes 

VE and I recommend that the changes are effective as of now and not 
retroactive back to the start of the plan  A retroactive date would weaken 
the plan as it stands and take out some of the teeth that we put in at its 
inception

Subject RE Clickathome  Proposed treatment for Involuntary Terminations  
Business Reorganizations


 To all the severance pay plan is not affected  Please refer to the 
original language 

Reason for this email Gain consensus on this change 


Business Issue  Find alternatives to the PC forfeiture penalty when an 
employee who has participated in the Clickathome program is involuntarily 
terminated 
   due to business reorganizations

Proposed Alternative  Replace the cash forfeiture penalty with imputed 
income to be reported on yearend W   The alternative defers or removes 
the cash impact to the    employee  Employees moving to other Enron units 
who currently do not participate in the program such as PGE and EFS will not 
be required to    report the PC as imputed income as long as they remain in a 
whollyowned division

New Process   Requires payroll administration

Timing   Effective immediately  
   Question  Do you want this retroactive to program inception


Other Applications The imputed income option could be expanded to all types 
of terminations However in doing so would allow easier entry into the 
program
   when an employee is planning to leave the company voluntarily   No 
recommendation at this time to change the forfeiture penalty for these 
other    types of separations


Please email me with your vote as Kalen is interested in enacting this change 
as soon as possible for the current redeployment candidates  Thanks

You know I love this idea  BUT I still think we need to let Ken personally 
address the shots he has taken  It is just not the same to have Jeff say 
it is okay that the AG of California wants to put Ken in a cell with Spike  
I strongly believe we need to give Ken a forum too as he has been at the 
center of alot of the recent noise  I still believe a video with both of 
them is the right way to goThe State of Enron  I think Jeffs Corner is a 
great idea toocant we do both  Ok I have said this enoughI will go

Subject Your corner on the intranet

Jeff 

Our Internal Communications group is continuing to look for ways to 
communicate with employees in a timely manner about hot topics that are of 
interest to them  Were also looking to increase your exposure with 
employees  We have a new idea which Sherri discussed briefly with you a 
couple of weeks ago  Its called Jeffs Corner and it will be a regular 
video message that will be posted on the intranet  which can be accessed by 
 of our employees  

This is how it will work  We will tape a  minute video of you talking 
about whats top of mind at that moment  The tone and style will be like 
your floor meetings one of your best employee venues casual and 
conversational  We suggest the first topic be The State of Enron  There 
is a lot of talk among employees about the cheap shots weve taken as a 
company and by you and Ken about the decline in our stock price and about 
the widespread redeployment efforts   These recent events are  beginning to 
affect morale  Employees are concerned and want to be assured that were on 
the right side that they will have jobs that Enron will be here next year  
Youve helped reassure them about these things at recent floor meetings 
however that is only a small part of our global work force  Having your own 
corner on the intranet will have a farther reach and we have the capability 
to do this inhouse at very low cost  

We recommend making this a regular communication feature at least monthly 
although since this would only involve a few minutes of your time you could 
even tape a message to employees weekly  The nice thing about this medium is 
we have the ability to respond immediately to current events and having you 
speak to employees gives the message credibility  

Future topics could address new cost saving procedures update on Dabhol the 
PRC reasons behind an organizational announcement The Pulse survey etc  
Wed like this to be a forum where you can talk about topics youd like to 
discuss

Ive checked with the technical team and we have the capability do this 
now  I will check your calendar with Sherri  Let me know if you have any 
questions

Mary

THE FINAL WORD 
CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF AN ENORmous stupidity crisis Californians have 
been sitting in the dark because  they didnt turn the lights on
They say theyre short of electricity Yes they are Between  and  
Californias electricity consumption increased by  percent Meanwhile 
Californias capacity to generate electricity shrank by five percent even as 
the state hesitated to build new power lines to tap into neighboring states 
power supplies 
Californians didnt want dams across their rivers derricks on their ocean 
power lines across their borders or fossil fuel smoke in their sky These 
might interfere with all the smart things Californians do such as 
hangglide California was going to rely on negawatts  dramatic power 
conservation But California regulators put price controls on electricity 
that lowered prices and even Californians werent dumb enough to skip a 
bargain And California was going to rely on alternative power generation 
With all the puffery from Silicon Valley dotcom startups wind farms 
wouldnt be a problem And doesnt Gwyneth Paltrows star shine bright enough 
to operate a solar panel But it turns out that alternative power generation 
is an alternative mostly to generating power 
Californians are people who insist on growing their own vegetables but they 
wont dig up the pretty lawn wont plant anything for fear of getting dirty 
and they use fragrant bath salts from The Body Shop instead of smelly 
compost Let them make their crudites with crab grass President Bush was 
wrong to grant an extension of executive orders requiring outofstate 
utilities to supply power to California And everyone is wrong to listen to 
Californians whine about electricity deregulation 
There never was any deregulation The California Public Utilities Commission 
merely changed its regulations which apparently werent stupid enough to 
meet Golden State standards Under Californias  reregulation plan 
electric companies sold their generating plants and became distributors They 
were required to buy their power on the wholesale spot market and forbidden 
to enter into any longterm power supply contracts Retail electricity prices 
were lowered by  percent and frozen at the new rate until March  
This is like requiring AP to sell you porterhouse at  a pound no matter 
what the price of beef on the hoof Imagine how many steaks there would be 
and how many supermarkets Go to one of those boardedup grocery stores 
purchase a phantom Tbone screw it into a ceiling fixture and try to light 
your house Youre in California 
Californians devised a system of electricity sales that ignored every 
dimension of the free market Interesting that the Information Economy is 
centered in a place thats immune to information The free market is a 
yardstick and Californians got smacked with it Mideast oil jitters cold 
weather natural gas price spikes and the plain unpredictable freedom of the 
free market caused wholesale electricity costs to rise and California 
utilities to go  billion into the red 
Californias governor Gray Davis responded with the full force of bikini 
beach brain In a January  speech to the state legislature Davis proposed 
creating a state agency to buy generating plants and build new ones He 
threatened to expropriate power generators and transmission grids He called 
for laws to allow criminal prosecution of wholesale suppliers who withheld 
electricity from California markets And he said the states universities and 
community colleges would build cogenerating plants and become energy 
independent With gas produced by the cafeteria food Gray Davis sounded 
like Joseph Stalin with the IQ of Keanu Reeves Everyone should understand 
that there are other more drastic measures that I am prepared to take if I 
have to Davis declaimed 
Take is the key word Grabby Californians tried to regulate themselves into 
some cheap electricity Hoggish California power companies went along because 
the stateimposed retail price ceiling was also a retail price floor 
According to the Los Angeles Times during the first  months of the scheme 
Pacific Gas and Electric and California Edison made  billion from the 
legally required markup between wholesale and retail electric prices 
Californians want to snatch that money back Consumer advocates around 
California said it did not matter that the utilities were returning 
investments to their shareholders reported the January  Washington Post 
They took the money and ran said state senator John Burton As opposed to 
Californians who took the electricity and rollerbladed Now the juice and 
the jack are both gone and the California legislature has had to pass a bill 
authorizing  billion to try to clean up the mess 
But the Californians could still pull a scam The bill mandates longterm 
power contracts at rates that are way above what future prices should be The 
hope one guesses is that Congress or the President or somebody will let 
the state skip out on those contracts once the costs are lower 
It would be wrong to call Californians stupid Theyre sleazy too

Subject Enron Expatriates in India

Steve

I wanted to give you the latest figures on Enron expatriates in India  There 
are currently  Enron expatriate employees based in India accompanied by 
six dependants  In addition Enron has responsibility for  expatriate 
contractors working for DPC and Lingtec primarily at Dabhol  The total of 
 expatriates for whom Enron is directly responsible is broken down by 
location as follows   in Mumbai  at Dabhol and three in Baroda  By 
company they are broken down as follows  Enron India   eight plus three 
dependants EOGIL  nine plus one dependant EBS  one plus two dependants 
DPC  seven and Lingtec  nine  These figures are likely to continue to 
trend downward Jane Wilsons departure on Friday for example will reduce 
the Enron India expatriate presence to seven plus three dependants

We are confident that the evacuation plan now in place provides the best 
possible prospect of successfully evacuating all of these expatriates in the 
event of danger  As a contingency the plan also includes the evacuation of 
all  expatriates working at the Dabhol site although a largescale 
evacuation from Dabhol is more problematic especially now that the monsoon 
season has started  A coordinated plan was needed since the limited number 
of available helicopters meant that the evacuation plans drawn up by 
individual contractors such as Bechtel were all drawing upon the same 
resources

As you know Enrons security situation in India remains stable  We are in 
the final stages of implementing security upgrades for our employees and 
offices there

Subject Stella Chan  Project Summer transfers

Steve  Cindy

Just want to state a case for this move before everyone starts up on the 
movement moratorium issues surronding the  EI companies which I understand 
is still in place

Stella Chan Director level is one of  expats Apachi have seconded into our 
SK Enron JV in Korea Because they all mobilized at the same time Darrell 
Kinder and I put in place a rotation plan whereby some would leave early 
some extend so we didnt have everyone leaving the JV at the same time Its 
worked well to date and weve mamanged to keep the Partners happy with the 
moves replacements

Bottom line with respect to the Project Summer moratorium in my view is 
that because Stella will be replaced she is no longer part of the 
intellectual capital the buyer or any future buyer is seeking to retain 
and so the move should go ahead

Hope you concur

Darrell

Stella Chans contract will conclude March   She had shown some desire 
to repatriate early and under the repatriation agreement I allowed her to 
start her search six months prior Stellas search was very quick and she 
has landed a job with the Corporate Public Affairs group under Harry 
Kingerski who works for Rick Shapiro who works for Steve Kean She has set 
a preliminary job switch for October  

This does not cause me too much concern for as you are aware Waymon Votaw 
who works in the Southern Cone group under John Guidry has shown a desire to 
be Stellas replacement The timing of this could work out real well Please 
pass this to the powers to be for approval so I may move forward with the 
next step with both individuals

Thanks

Please see the attached from Beth Tilney "
2000-08-31T10:17:00-07:00,"I enjoyed talking with you the other day and am happy to answer your 
questions  both the Texas position and the Washington DC position report to 
Rick Shapiro  From a government affairs standpoint Ive divided the world 
between Ricks group the Americas and Mark Schroeders group Europe and 
Asia  Both Rick and Mark report to me

Joe Allen continues as part of the Texas legislative team working for the 
head of that group formerly Kathleen Magruder

Terry Thorn has taken a commercial position in Enron and no longer works on 
government affairs issues for the company except to the extent we call on 
various executives to help from timetotime

Subject Thanks  Questions

STEVE I very much appreciate your call the day before yesterday and your
asking if I would like to compete to succeed Joe Hillings as head of Enrons
Washington office Although until that moment I hadnt thought of returning
to Washington except to serve again in national office I would be pleased
to talk further about this opportunity with you or your recruiter

In recalling our conversation I realize that twice you asked if I had any
questions and if I had been quick to take advantage of your offer I would
have asked how government relations are handled at Enron To whom does Joe
Hillings report to you or to Terry Thorne You mentioned a woman who
currently has responsibility for government relations in Texas and some
neighboring states but is leaving for another job at Enron to whom does she
report Then there is Joe Allen whom I have known since our days in the
Legislature doesnt he also handle Texas affairs

I am sorry I didnt ask you all this on Tuesday Whatever the answers its
clear that government relations are  much more central to the work of Enron
than at Compaq which is why it would be a very exciting place to work
Thanks again for your call your courtesy and your indulgence with this
tardy line of questioning With best wishes CHASE

correct this is the way we handle regulatory counsel in other regions 
particularly the US  What Derrick and I have agreed with regard to counsel 
selection is  govt reg affairs picks the counsel we want to use and he 
retains a veto which has rarely if ever been exercised  Once we have 
retained counsel we will use that counsel on other regulatory projects unless 
the legal department starts to have a problem with the firm eg because they 
represent someone against us in litigation  Again I dont recall this ever 
being an issue  It seems to work  outside counsel gets the message that we 
will look dimly on any firm that squares off against us and we select the 
most qualified counsel on our issues

Jeff Skilling Visit The Nikkei and the Tokyo University have now made the 
decision to invite Mr Skilling to give the key note address at the symposium 
on  November in Tokyo As mentioned the symposium is the most prestigious 
conference on IT in Japan

While the conference itself receives significant media attention the

Ken Lay Visit Balancing the need to push out the arrangement of high level 
meetings as far as possible with the desire to have a meeting with Prime 
Minister Mori prior to the US Presidential election the week commencing  
October would be the optimum time for a visit by Mr Lay PM Mori is generally 
available in that week We will get a preferred time from the PMs chief 
secretary first thing tomorrow morning Tokyo time 

Jeff Skilling Visit The boards of Nikkei and Tokyo University Institute of 
Advanced Studies have yet to make a decision on the key note speaker for the 
one day invitation only seminar to be held on  October As mentioned the 
boards will choose between the chairman of Cisco and Jeff Skilling The 
conference is focused on the IT revolution and an invitation only event for 
approximately  of Japans corporate leaders

The speaking panel and topics for discussion will be developed around the key 
note speaker If Mr Skilling were to give the key note speech it is likely 
that key senior Government Ministers would be asked to present at the 
seminar 

Following the Prime Ministers commitment at the Okinawa summit of 
USbillion expenditure in the region on IT infrastructure and education 
Japans focus on ecommerce is almost reaching fever pitch There will be 
significant interest in the conference from senior levels of Government and 
the business community Further as you would expect with the involvement of 
the Nikkei there is typically significant media coverage associated with the 
key note speakers presentation

  California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Power Costs 
  By Rebecca Smith

  California lawmakers voted to extend modest relief to San Diego residents 
burdened with
  high electricity bills and set the groundwork for faster construction of 
badly needed power
  plants They stopped short however of passing legislation that would roll 
back retail power
  rates to levels seen prior to deregulation 

  Late Wednesday lawmakers sent a bill to Gov Gray Davis that limits to  
cents per
  kilowatt hour the amount that small customers of San Diego Gas  Electric 
Co can be
  charged The utility is allowed to add powerdelivery and other reasonable 
costs to that
  commodity price

  The price equivalent to a bulk power cost of  per megawatt hour is far 
higher than the
  average price of power for  of the  months in which Californias market 
has been
  deregulated But in June and July the average price of power obtained by 
the utility from a
  statesanctioned energy auction rose to  cents and  cents 
respectively compared
  with the  cents and  cents charged in those months a year earlier

  Passed directly through to customersthe resulting bills sparked a near 
mutiny The
  ratecap measure applies to residential and small commercial customers as 
well as to
  schools and hospitals

  In addition to the rate cap which can be adjusted upward or downward by 
the California
  Public Utilities Commission until December  the legislature earmarked 
 million of
  generalfund revenue which can be used to subsidize San Diego power costs 
if they greatly
  exceed the centsperkilowatthour rate For now the utility would be 
expected to make
  up any difference between revenue collected and the actual cost

  Steve Baum chairman of Sempra Energy parent of San Diego Gas  Electric 
Co said the
  ratecap measure is deeply flawed because it limits the amount prices can 
rise but sets
  no floor That means any shortfall could grow  without a mechanism for 
customers to pay
  it down  until the end of the ratecap period which could last until 
December  or
  December 

  Mr Baum said Sempra stands to suffer an undercollection of perhaps  
million provided
  future prices approximate the New York Mercantile Exchange forward prices 
through
  December  Its irreparably damaging to Sempra he said because it 
creates
  tremendous uncertainty that makes it hard for the San Diego energy company 
to finance
  new projects such as a new transmission line

  The legislature also appeared likely to approve a bill speeding up the 
permit process for the
  construction of new power plants in part by beefing up staffs of 
regulatory agencies that
  review the plans

2000-09-08T10:03:00-07:00,"Got your message  Im testifying at the Congressional hearing and Dasovich 
is covering FERC  I think Jeffs comments were taken out of context  He 
said policymakers do need to take care of small customers whose bills are 
tripling  Frankly wed get slaughtered if we said anything else  But he 
also said there is a right way and a wrong way to do it  Enron and others 
had provided a market based answer by offering a fixed price deal to SDGE 
which would have enabled them to cap rates to those who had not switched  
California elected instead to cap rates and deficit spend ie create a 
deferral account  I dont think we can stand for anything that doesnt 
protect the small customers but we can continue to emphasize the market 
based solutions  One of the messages in my testimony will be customers 
should be encouraged to choose  Those who did are doing fine"

Subject Fletcher School Enron

Dear Steve   Last month while at my reunion at the Fletcher School of Law 
and Diplomacy
at Tufts University some of the school officials told me that Enron has 
hired about eight 
Fletcher graduates recently and is happy with them   The school is also 
happy and wants
to strengthen its relationship with Enron   They had earlier this year 
contacted a Laura 
Kalmans Director of Community Development at Enron to discuss various ideas 
for cooperation 
with Enron that would strengthen our capacity in environmental matters and 
give the students
exposure to real world issues but nothing happened and they lost contact  

They asked me who they should contact to find out how to pursue this and I 
said 
I thought it might be you or someone under you    They now want to send a 
letter
to someone at Enron on this proposal  It is OK if it is addressed to you or 
should I tell
them another name   Please advise me how to steer them in the right 
direction    

Many thanks  David Merrill

Dear Ambassador Merrill

I understand that you and Betsy Ginsberg had a conversation at reunion last 
month about a possible
partnership between the Fletcher School and Enron  Thank you for generously 
offering to help us
explore this connection  We believe there are strong synergies between 
Professor Bill Moomaws
International Environment and Resource Policy program and Enrons business 
model  There is
currently a strong recruiting relationship between Enron and Fletcher there 
are nine Fletcherites
at Enron at this time  Im confident that our strong recruiting relationship 
is a solid first step
from which to launch an even stronger partnership

In order to explore expanding this relationship Ms Elise Kalmans Director 
of Community
Development agreed to arrange a meeting for Bill and me last spring  
Unfortunately the scheduling
did not work out and Ms Kalmans then began a maternity leave so we had 
trouble identifying a new
point of contact

I appreciate your suggestion that we aim to work through Stephen Kean  As 
Senior Vice President for
Public and Environmental and Government Affairs he does sound like the ideal 
contact with whom to
discuss Professor Moomaws program and its students How do you suggest we 
proceed  Should we send
a letter from Interim Dean Trachtman to ask if Mr Kean would be willing to 
meet with Professor
Moomaw  May I mention that you suggested we write him

At Betsys suggestion I have attached the presentation outline we prepared 
for Enron along with
the letter we originally mailed to Elise  I would be very interested in any 
suggestions you may
have  If you have any trouble opening the powerpoint file or word document 
please let me know and
I would be happy to mail or fax them  Thank you again for your kind offer of 
assistance

Sincerely

Laura Karch
Associate Director External Relations

Subject ACTION ALERT  ELECTRONIC MONITORING


URGENT ACTION REQUESTED

On Thursday September  the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the House
Committee on the Judiciary is slated to consider HR  the Notice of
Electronic Monitoring Act  HR  is sponsored by Subcommittee Chairman
Charles Canady RFL and cosponsored by subcommittee member Bob Barr
RGA  The bill would require employers to notify employees about
electronic monitoring  The National Association of Manufacturers urges its
members to notify their employees about internal monitoring practices
Nevertheless HR  is being placed on a fast track that could allow for
many unintended consequences  The NAM urges you to contact the Subcommittee
on the Constitution at   and subcommittee members see below
to urge postponement

Message

The September  hearing on HR  was not well advertised and did not
include the views and concerns of employers

Because of the nature of computers and other electronic equipment any
electronic monitoring bill has to be carefully written so that it does not
interfere with other fiduciary and legal responsibilities of employers

This is far too important an issue to rush through the process

For more information call Larry Fineran at   or email him at

Subject Thursday Meeting on Winter Gas Prices

Ken

I have invited the following individuals to join us at the  pm Thursday 
meeting to review the draft of your Columbus speech on the natural gas 
situation

Hamd AlhkayatHamd has replaced Andrew Miles in the rotation and will be 
helping me with your presentations as well as being the lead with Jeffs 
speeches

Shelley CormanShelley has been developing messages for the current and 
anticipated gas situation and pipeline safety for the gas pipeline group  
The safety issue could come up in your QA

Stinson GibnerStinson is with the research group that has generated some of 
the more complex slides in your draft dealing with volatility and historic 
futures pricing

Gil MuhlGil markets gas products to customers and is speaking at an AGA 
conference on the gas supply and price situation the day before your talk  
His group is focusing on new products to help endusers with winter 
volatility  I have asked Gil to send you his presentation as well for the 
meeting

Back to your presentation the draft slides of which I am delivering to you 
today Dan Yergin thought it would be appropriate for you to give an 
overview of the situation as the teacher or professor  Some questions 
that you could address would include

Where has the industry come from and what lessons have we learned

How is the business different today

What public policy conclusions are implicit in this history

I think our comparative advantage over the specialists who will be presenting 
before and after your keynote is that you have been there in the evolution 
of the natural gas market and Enron is at the forefront of helping customers 
deal with price and supply uncertainty  There is also a good opportunity to 
stress the need for new industry best practices more hedging and the 
right public policies to deal with this issue from do no harm to expanding 
incentives in the market

On Workplace Sleeves Few Political Hearts

An example is Enron the Houston energy conglomerate which even suggests how 
much employees should give
Kenneth L Lay the chairman recently sent top executives a memo on his 
stationery asking them to contribute
 each to the Bush campaign said Steven J Kean an executive vice 
president This year Enron and its
employees have contributed more than  to the Bush campaign he said 

But there are limits even at companies like Enron We might tell employees 
to go out and vote but nobody tells
them who to vote for or passes out brochures Mr Kean said That kind of 
thing is just not acceptable in todays
workplace

Subject meeting



Dear Steven

Just to refresh your memory  we met in June to discuss future job
prospects at Enron  At that time you had offered to get me in touch with
someone in the Finance Division  at Enron to discuss similar topics  I
am sorry to bother you with matters such as this but I am still very
interested in a position with Enron and would like to follow through on
this offer if you are still willing  As an aside another contact gave
me the name of Rob Bradley and suggested that I get in touch with him  I
dont know if that is who you had in mind or not

I am moving my wife to Houston next week and will be available to meet
any time from Friday August  until Thursday August   After that I
leave for a conference in Seattle but will back in Houston for one day on
Thursday August th

As for my timetable which at the time you had told me to keep you
apprised of I will continue in my position at KState for the Fall
semester  After that Im a free man  I have a couple of academic offers
for temporary positions in the Spring one at Rice and one at UTAustin
The latter is very appealing but would require my absence from home
during the weeks  As such I am still wide open beginning in January

In spite of the fact that I awoke at AM in order to get to the
airport the day that I met Jim Steffes and you I got a lot out of our
meeting  I was very impressed with Enron and what you had to say and am
hopeful about future prospects with the company  I remain very interested
in a future position at Enron and perhaps in Public and Government
Affairs I hope I have that right

Thank you for everything  I hope that you had a nice vacation

Sincerely

Mike Sadler

2000-09-13T02:44:00-07:00,"attached is a copy of my california testimony  The proceeding was somewhat 
productive but turned into a witch hunt at a couple of points  Our view on 
this is  the problem is fairly straightforward demand increases and new 
supplies are inhibited so prices go up and shortages ensue  sound 
familiar and the solutions are straightforward site the power plants 
suppliers are begging to build let the utilities hedge outside the exchange 
and finish the job of opening the interstate grid so power can get from where 
it is to where it is needed

What it comes down to at this point is FERC is the only entity with the 
authority to start fixing this problem now  Congress isnt going to get 
anything done this year and the California legislature is thankfully out of 
session now  Our political leaders need to give FERC the room they need to 
act

Good luck on your speech and give me a call sometime

With Dereg Under FireEnron Calif Elec Business Heats Up

  LOS ANGELES Dow Jones While federal regulators try to find a way to
stabilize soaring wholesale electricity prices in California Enron Corp
ENE has been quietly striking up deals with some suburban communities to
sell them fixedprice power at a lower rate

  In the past month the Houstonbased electricity service provider entered
into longterm fixedrate contracts with the city of Roseville and is
negotiating similar deals with the cities of San Marcos and Chula Vista Both
of those cities currently get their power from San Diego Gas  Electric Co a
unit of Sempra Energy Inc SRE and pay market rates for electricity
  Enron has also struck a deal with Starwood Hotels  Resorts Worldwide Inc
HOT one of the worlds largest hospitality companies to sell the company
electricity at a fixed rate for the next  years The company has four hotels
in California three of which buy their power from SDGE

  Sources close to the matter said Enron has contracted to sell the hotel
power at about  cents per kilowatthour compared with the  cents KWh
Starwood said it was charged by SDGE in August

  Neither company would disclose the terms of the deal But Starwood said it
expects to reduce its energy costs by more than  million over the next 
years

  Enron the largest trader of electricity and natural gas in the US will
purchase power to cover such contracts on the wholesale markets and use its
experience to manage the risks while paying a fee to utilities like SDGE for
use of their distribution networks

  That really is our core strength said Harold Buchanan chief operating
officer for Enron Energy Services North America We understand how to manage
those risks

  High Rates Driving Industrial Customers Cities To Switch

  The growing interest in fixedprice supply contracts is fueling a comeback
of sorts for Enron

  The Houstonbased company had tried to break into Californias retail power
market just after deregulation even spending nearly  million to advertise
the venture during the Super Bowl But Enron gave up trying to win residential
customers in  citing disappointing response and lowerthanexpected
profits

  That was when deregulation and competitive power markets were full of
promise Oddly enough now that deregulation is coming under attack in
California soaring power prices are building demand for Enrons services

  The company is fielding calls from large industrial customers in San Diego
that have seen their utility bills triple in the past three months and are
interested in signing longterm fixedrate contracts Buchanan said

  Overall what Enron can provide is reliability pricing in San Diego thats
written in stone Buchanan said Its far cheaper than what theyre paying
now with the utilities

  A number of large industrial customers negotiating with Enron declined to
comment

  The city of Roseville near Sacramento entered into a  million contract
with Enron last month to purchase  megawatts of electricity for five years
at  per megawatthour

  Furthermore the city has started talks with Enron about building and
operating a megawatt natural gasfired power plant that city officials
expect will contribute to lower costs for the purchase of electricity

  Mayor Harry Crabb said the plant could protect residents from the price
spikes that have plagued customers of SDGE since June

  San Marcos in San Diego County is proposing to switch electricity service
for its  residents to Enron from SDGE  a move the City Council said
could shave about  million a year off the citys power bill Enron has said
it would offer the city terms nearly identical to those it offered Roseville

  An SDGE spokesman said last week that the utility supports such
arrangements saying theyre one way deregulation is supposed to work

  Enron offered earlier this summer to sell power to SDGE itself for four
years at a fixed rate of  cents KWh but the utility said the price was too
high

  California Gov Gray Davis signed legislation two weeks ago to cap
electricity rates for SDGEs customers at  cents KWh

GOVERNOR DAVIS PRESSES FERC FOR ACTION ON WHOLESALE POWER RATES Calls on
Federal Regulators to Reduce Prices Issue Refunds

GOVERNOR DAVIS NAMES KAHN CHAIR OF THE GOVERNORS CLEAN ENERGY GREEN TEAM



OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR


PR
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September  

GOVERNOR DAVIS PRESSES FERC FOR ACTION ON WHOLESALE POWER RATES
Calls on Federal Regulators to Reduce Prices Issue Refunds

SAN DIEGO  At a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC hearing today
in San Diego Governor Gray Davis reiterated his call to federal regulators
to intervene to the fullest extent possible to lower electricity prices in
California

FERC bears responsibility to ensure that a workably competitive market
exists before California consumers and Californias economy are subjected to
unconstrained marketbased electricity prices said Governor Davis in a
statement read by Energy Oversight Board Chairman Michael Kahn
Consequently I renew my prior request that the Commission act with utmost
speed to intervene to the fullest extent possible to restore wholesale
prices to fair levels and to remedy harms that have resulted from the
exercise of market power

Governor Davis noted that he and state lawmakers have taken dramatic action
in recent weeks to provide rate relief While these actions should provide
shortterm rate predictability and longerterm benefits to customers in
terms of improved supplies the fundamental problem of exorbitant wholesale
prices still exists and remains the responsibility of FERC to address said
the governor No combination of state actions can substitute for federal
action to ameliorate the problems of Californias wholesale markets

Governor Davis has taken the following actions in reaction to rising
electricity prices in San Diego

On June  he called for emergency reduction of electricity use by all
state facilities in the San Francisco Bay area in response to electricity
emergency and rolling blackouts

On June  he called on chairpersons of the Public Utilities Commission
PUC to analyze the conditions that led to electricity shortages in the San
Francisco Bay area the previous day including a statewide perspective on
the price and delivery of electricity Report was completed submitted to
the governor and released on August 

On July   Governor Davis called on federal and state regulators to
take swift action to extend the caps on wholesale electric rates in
California and provide San Diego ratepayers with million of dollars in
refunds

In letters written by the governor to two state regulatory agencies and two
Californiabased panels charged with overseeing Californias power market
he called for a coordinated state effort to urge federal regulators to take
strong measures to reduce power rates in both the short and longterm

On August   Governor Davis issued three Executive Orders designed to
reduce energy consumption by state government and speed up the time it takes
new power generating facilities to win approval from state agencies

On August   Governor Davis called on the Public Utilities Commission
PUC to establish a twoyear plan that would cut electricity rates by
nearly half for residential and business customers of San Diego Gas 
Electric

The governor also reached an agreement with the California Grocers
Association that will save enough electricity to provide power to between
 and  homes during periods of peak demand as grocers agreed to
reduce power consumption by  percent during Stage One emergencies

On August   Governor Davis wrote a letter to President Clinton
urging him to expedite FERCs investigation to determine whether current
electric rates in San Diego were unjust

On August   Governor Davis called on President Clinton to release
emergency funds from the LowIncome Home Energy Assistance Program LIHEAP
to the state to help lowincome Californians pay their rapidlyrising
electricity bills

On August   President Clinton responded to Governor Davis request
by releasing  million in emergency funds to help lowincome Southern
Californians cope with the surge in their electricity bills The President
also asked federal regulators to speed up their investigation into the
operation of US power markets and urged the Small Business Administration
to use its credit programs to help small firms hurt by the price increases

On August   Governor Davis reached agreement with legislators on
legislation to provide relief to San Diego ratepayers The governor signed
two bills into law on September  

Please see attached letter below

  

SEPTEMBER  

STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS

TO THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION CONCERNING ITS INVESTIGATION OF
WHOLESALE PRICE ESCALATION IN CALIFORNIA

The Summer of  has confronted California with an electricity crisis that
seriously threatens the safety health and well being of citizens and
businesses throughout the state At the heart of the crisis is the
extraordinary run up in prices for wholesale electric energy and ancillary
services accompanied by deteriorating service and reliability In San
Diego electric customers bills have more than doubled this summer
threatening permanent harm to businesses and the health and welfare of
residential customers in the warm southern climate All remaining California
electric consumers are faced with similar prospects as their legislated rate
freeze periods come to an end In San Francisco we saw rolling blackouts for
the first time in our history

As soon as the dimensions of the crisis became evident I directed
California regulators including the Public Utilities Commission and the
Electricity Oversight Board and the Independent System Operator to take
immediate steps to identify and implement specific measures to mitigate the
damage including restoring price caps at Summer  levels I am happy to
report that those measures have been adopted although not without
considerable resistance from selfinterested parties

In recent weeks I have worked with the California Legislature to enact
further relief within the existing framework of options now available to the
state These include provisions to stabilize retail rates expedite
generation licensing where possible implement targeted demand reduction and
demand response and remove constraints in transmission and distribution
systems I have also established a task force comprised of key state
officials which is developing measures to increase energy efficiency and
alternative supplies and to expedite permitting by state agencies

While these actions should provide shortterm rate predictability and
longerterm benefits to customers in terms of improved supplies the
fundamental problem of exorbitant wholesale prices still exists and remains
the responsibility of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to address
No combination of state actions can substitute for federal action to
ameliorate the problems in Californias wholesale markets

A joint report submitted to me on August nd by the Chairman of the
California Electricity Oversight Board and the President of the California
Public Utilities Commission concluded that exorbitant wholesale prices in
California result from wholesale market dysfunction and the exercise of
market power by sellers Subsequent reports by the Market Analysis
Department and the Market Surveillance Committee of the California
Independent System Operator reach the same conclusions Subsequent behavior
of wholesale electric prices during August confirms their conclusions and
subjects California to further economic damage While I remain hopeful that
California wholesale markets may ultimately become competitive and become
capable of serving the interests of consumers and the public I cannot and
will not accept the liabilities to California that result from the current
situation for even a short period I intend to take any and all steps
necessary to restore economic stability to the electric service
infrastructure of California

FERC bears the responsibility under its organic act to assure just and
reasonable wholesale electric rates FERC bears responsibility to ensure
that a workably competitive market exists before California consumers and
Californias economy are subjected to unconstrained marketbased
electricity prices Consequently I renew my prior request that the
Commission act with utmost speed to intervene to the fullest extent possible
to restore wholesale prices to fair levels and to remedy harms that have
resulted from the exercise of market power

  Sweltering weather across California pushed the states heatstressed 
electricity grid close
  to meltdown Monday and state power officials urged electricity 
conservation because today
  and Wednesday could be even worse

  Power was cut to hundreds of large business customers and about  
residential and
  business airconditioner and agricultural pumping customers Monday after 
the California
  Independent System Operator which runs the electricity grid for about  
of the state
  declared a Stage  power emergency At Stage  when the grid is using more 
than  of
  available power the states big investorowned utilities are asked to 
interrupt power to
  customers that have agreed to this voluntary action in exchange for 
discounted rates

  Grid reliability was threatened when two electricity units in Northern 
California stopped
  working for a time as heavy airconditioner demand began to push power use 
higher
  CalISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle said

  Demand peaked at about  megawatts on the CalISO grid but the two 
unidentified
  units representing about  megawatts of generation were returned to 
service in the
  afternoonin time to help keep the state from reaching its first Stage  
which would lead to
  neighborhood blackouts

  We were right on the edge of warning about a possible Stage  McCorkle 
said A couple
  of generators fell offline in late morning and that kind of gave everybody 
a scare

  A Stage  emergency would be declared if power reserves fall below in 
essence
  when the electricity grid is using more than  of available powerand 
rotating outages
  of nonessential customers for an hour or longer would become likely to keep 
the grid from
  failing That would result in widespread blackouts lasting several hours

  Electricity use was also high in the area served by the Los Angeles 
Department of Water
  and Power peaking near  megawatts Monday But DWP customers were not
  threatened by power interruptions or rolling blackouts because the 
municipal utility has
  more than enough generating capacity to meet demand

  Were doing OK as we have all summer long said DWP General Manager S 
David
  Freeman

  CalISO asked Southern California Edison Pacific Gas  Electric and San 
Diego Gas 
  Electric to call on all of their interruptiblepower customers to 
immediately stop using
  electricity representing a potential  megawatts or roughly the 
amount of electricity
  used by  million homes

  Thousands of students at College of the Canyons in Valencia experienced the 
California
  equivalent of a snow day Monday when power outage alarms rang about  
pm the
  seventh time this year college spokesman Sue Bozman said If the college 
doesnt pull the
  plug it pays a big fine

  For several years we saved  a year by being on this 
interruptibleservice plan
  said Bozman who with other administrators finished the work day with 
mobile phones and
  portable computers But when the alarm rings and we decline to turn off 
our power its a
  whole different ballgame

  One such day in May during final exams the college didnt cut power and 
penalties totaled
   she said

  During the height of Mondays power crisis PGEwhose territory suffered 
local blackouts
  on June  in a similar reliability emergencykept an open telephone line 
to CalISO for
  minutebyminute updates spokesman Ron Low said

  SCE and the other utilities begged customers to use as little electricity 
as possible and
  grocery stores around the state voluntarily reduced lighting and other 
power use to comply

  Were issuing a call to action a call that everyone needs to take 
seriously Pam Bass
  SCEs senior vice president for customer service said in a statement as 
electricity use
  soared Monday If the demand for power does not decrease soon we will be 
directed by
  the state to begin shutting off power for blocks of customers Everyone 
needs to cut their
  use of power now to avoid forced outages

  Today and Wednesday could be even more challenging CalISO is predicting 
peak use of
   megawatts for today Peak demand was expected to be  megawatts 
on
  Monday but conservation and powerinterruption programs kept the total 
lower

  We are anticipating tomorrow to be a good deal like today SCE 
spokeswoman Karen
  ShepardGrimes said Monday Electricity demand in SCE territory peaked at 

  megawatts before the Rosemeadbased utility asked power customers to cut 

  megawatts of electricity It got really touchy today she said

Managers Journal Heir to Greatness
By Gary Hamel

Sometime in the next few months the board of General Electric will anoint a 
successor to the worlds most
celebrated corporate leader Running GE may be as Jack Welch claims the 
best job in the world but his
successor may find it to be one of the toughest as well  not because 
anything is going wrong at GE but because
so much is going right and has been for so long 

Mr Welchs successor will inherit a company that is already stupendously 
valuable that has already shed most of
its unwanted pounds and has already set a string of performance records How 
do you do better than that

This is more than a rhetorical question for GEs next chairman Pity for a 
moment a few other heirs to greatness
Doug Ivester was gone just  months after following the legendary Roberto 
Goizueta at CocaCola Dale Morrison
lasted less than four years at Campbell Soup after taking over from 
costcutter extraordinaire David Johnson British
Airways Bob Ayling got pushed out after he had struggled unsuccessfully to 
fill the shoes of Colin Marshall And
Durk Jager prematurely stepped down as Procter  Gambles chairman after 
failing to live up to the lofty standards
set by earlier PG leaders 

Pretenders 

None of the pretenders succeeded in building greatness on top of greatness 
In three of these cases the board
brought back a recently retired CEO or chairman to shore up investor 
confidence Sadly Goizueta who died in
October  could not reprise his earlier success at CocaCola 

GEs next chairman will have to exceed Mr Welchs nearmythic 
accomplishments if GE is to continue to fly high
Like Cisco Intel WalMart Nokia and any other company that is exploring 
the outer atmosphere GE must struggle
ever harder to resist the laws that threaten to flatten the arc of success 
the law of large numbers the law of
diminishing returns and the law of averages 

 The law of large numbers Over the past decade GEs market value has 
multiplied elevenfold  to more than 
billion from  billion at the end of  Sustaining such a breathtaking 
pace of value growth gets progressively
harder as a company gets bigger As the most valuable company on the planet 
GE would need to grow its market
cap to nearly  trillion over the next five years to match the  
compounded annual growth rate it has achieved
over the past halfdecade 

One way of escaping the law of large numbers is to divide big things into 
small things One option for GE would be
to spin out its lowgrowth businesses as separate companies Over the past 
five years profits in two sectors 
appliances and plastics  were essentially flat Holding these businesses 
may generate a positive return on
invested capital but no investor would keep them inside a growth portfolio 
Why should GE 

If GEs next chairman cant muster the courage to leave the dawdlers behind 
perhaps he  or she  should spin out
the stars Of the eight large business segments for which GE reports results 
two  GE Capital and NBC  account
for nearly  of GEs fiveyear profit growth Sure GE Capital has 
benefited from its parents dirtcheap cost of
capital but from an investors point of view these advantages may be more 
than offset by the drag of laggardly
earnings growth in other GE businesses Looking beyond capital and 
broadcasting there are probably a dozen
other highgrowth candidates for spinouts in GEs other sectors 

Mr Welchs successor shouldnt be afraid to disassemble GE After all the 
goal is not to make GE the worlds
most valuable company but to make its shareholders the worlds most richly 
rewarded Shareholders dont care
whether GEs stock appreciates or whether its the stock of companies that GE 
has disgorged Breaking up is hard
to do But Mr Welchs successor may find that turning GE into the worlds 
first  trillion company is even harder 

 The law of diminishing returns Even the most successful strategies lose 
their potency over time For most of Mr
Welchs tenure GEs strategies of choice have been cost cutting and 
acquisitions From its unflinching approach to
downsizing in the mids to its more recent dedication to ebusiness Mr 
Welchs GE has been imaginative
and unrelenting in excising waste At the same time GEs top line has been 
buoyed up by a tidal wave of
acquisitions  more than  in the past three years many outside the US 

The payoff to all this cutting and deal making has been steadily accelerating 
earnings growth Net earnings grew
 in   in   in  and  in  Looking 
forward power dieting and binge buying
may not be enough to keep GEs earnings escalator rising ever skyward 

There are already signs that GE may be nearing the asymptotic end of the 
efficiency curve Between  and
 GEs revenue per employee increased by  Yet over the last decade 
revenue per employee grew by a
more modest  and has been essentially flat since  And while 
operating margins in GEs manufacturing
businesses have been steadily improving GEs net profit margin after all 
adjustments has remained pretty much
unchanged over the past five years 

What about acquisitions While industry consolidation still has a way to run 
particularly outside the US it seems
inevitable that it will become harder and harder for GE to find underpriced 
undermanaged fixeruppers After all at
the current furious pace of corporate coupling the US would be left with a 
single company by  

That leaves e Ecommerce will drive new efficiencies into GEs business 
processes but GE is not alone in
striving to eenable its businesses Ecommerce is rapidly becoming an 
information technology arms race  with
competitors making titfortat investments to reap titfortat efficiency 
gains And while efficiencybesotted CEOs are
counting on the Internet to shrink procurement costs savvy customers will be 
just as creative in using the Net to
beat down prices Whether GEs enthusiasm for all things e produces 
longlasting peerbeating profit growth
remains to be seen 

GEs next chairman may want to borrow a lesson or two from Enron which has 
been voted Americas most
innovative company five years running and displaced GE as the best managed 
company in Fortune magazines
last most admired survey Forty percent of Enrons  billion market value 
comes from businesses the company
wasnt even in three years ago  all of them are homegrown 

Forget acquisitions With GEs powerful brand global reach and fearsome 
capacity for execution theres no reason
GE shouldnt surpass Enron as a businessbuilding champ It is entirely 
reasonable to expect that GE could create
 to  new businesses over the next few years  with each adding an 
average of  billion to GEs market value 

Sooner or later GE is going to need an entirely new genre of wealthcreating 
strategies  and a much more
aggressive commitment to internally generated new business development may 
well be the most promising
candidate 

 The law of averages Over the past five years GEs price earnings ratio 
has tripled from just over  to more than
 The company is currently selling at a  premium to the market average 
P E But being a standout performer
for more than a few years at a time is a daunting challenge for any company 
large or small It seems that no
company can forever escape the steady tug of mediocrity 

At the end of  the Standard  Poors  included  companies that had 
been in the index for the entire
decade Fiftyfive of these companies among them GE managed to deliver top 
quartile shareholder returns in as
many as four years out of the previous  GEs top quartile results came in 
   and  If GEs
new chairman manages to extend this streak for another four years GE will 
set a new world record for none of the
 SP veterans achieved top quartile returns in as many as eight years out 
of  during the s and only four
companies  Oracle Home Depot Intel and Cisco  cleared the bar seven 
years out of  

If GE can fire up the entrepreneurial spirit in each of its employees it 
just might beat the odds Like most large
companies GE seems to be reluctant to encourage employees to start new 
businesses by giving them equity
stakes in new ventures While this isnt the only way to build businesses 
its one that cant be ignored in a world
where talented employees are often lured away by the promise of a big chunk 
of equity in a startup GE already
invests in startups via GE Equity  to the tune of  billion in  
Last year GE also repurchased  billion of
its own stock One wonders just what kind of new wealth GEs own employees 
might have been able to create if
they had been backed by this kind of capital 

To have any hope of escaping Mr Welchs shadow and matching his success 
GEs next chairman will have to
keep a simple truth in mind If youre trying to achieve unprecedented ends 
youre going to need unprecedented
means A breakup a few major spinouts a bottomtotop initiative focused 
on making GE as good at creating bold
new businesses as it is at improving existing businesses an absolute 
commitment to doubling or tripling GEs
internal growth rate  these are all potential candidates for the next big 
thing at GE 

Maybe just maybe GE will continue to fly high with its current success 
recipes One could argue that as long as
there are companies around the world that arent as wellmanaged as GE Mr 
Welchs magnificent buyandimprove
engine will have plenty of fuel Or that GEs Websmitten executives will 
discover Net advantages no one else has
yet dreamed of 

After  years under Mr Welch GE is habituated to meeting new challenges 
Moreover GE has a long history of
organizational and managerial innovation  it was among the first to 
decentralize along business unit lines embrace
disciplined strategic planning delayer its hierarchical organization and 
commit itself to becoming Webified from
stem to stern Like the Internet GE is diverse global flat meritocratic 
and nonhierarchical 

Maybe all of this will help GE to become one of the first companies to marry 
the rulebusting businessbuilding
ethos of the new economy with the old economy virtues of scale 
efficiency and quality If GE succeeds there
will be no more talk of new economy and old economy for GE will have managed 
to create a perfect synthesis of
old and new And the most perfectly developed specimen of the industrial age 
will have become the archetype for
the postindustrial corporation  a company that uses its size and 
operational excellence to crush the upstarts and
its industrytransforming innovation to constantly surprise the old farts 
This is a worthy and necessary aspiration
for the next leader of Americas preeminent corporation

Abreast of the Market
SP Index Seemed Tranquil This Year but
By ES Browning
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

Amid the storm that has swept the Nasdaq Composite Index this year the 
Standard  Poors stock index
looks like a sea of tranquility 

Since Jan  it has gone almost exactly nowhere starting the year at 
 and closing Friday at 

But beneath the quiet surface a furious battle is raging among the SPs 
components with some of last years
losers becoming this years winners 

Some of the most amazing performers are the naturalgas companies which are 
up about  as a group so far
this year The naturalgas index looks like an Internet stock from a year 
ago says Richard Bernstein chief
quantitative strategist at Merrill Lynch 

El Paso Energy is up  so far this year KeySpan Energy is up almost  
On top of its stock gain KeySpan
offers something some investors arent familiar with a  dividend 

Now the big question is should investors be plowing their money into the 
recent winners which also include drug
stocks brokeragefirm stocks and bank stocks Or is their surge a flash in 
the pan that will evaporate as investors
get over their jitters in the fall 

Higher oil prices helped send utility stocks up on Friday and most other 
stocks down The Dow Jones Industrial
Average fell  or  points to  leaving the bluechip 
index down  or  points for the
week 

The Nasdaq Composite Index was down  on the day and  on the week 
The Dow Jones Utility Average
however rose  or  points on Friday to a record  leaving it 
up  on the week 

The SP  still the broadest of the major market indexes dropped  on 
Friday But it is just  off its record
of  set March  In contrast the technologyheavy Nasdaq index is 
down  from its March  high 

Within the SP  though there have been some dramatic moves Utilities 
are up an astounding  just in the
time since the SP peaked on March  according to Ned Davis Research 
Financials and drug stocks are up
about  each  again since the SP hit a record 

Communications stocks on the other hand have fallen  in that period The 
SP s big tech stocks are
down more than  

Some analysts think the move that is under way is broader than a sector 
rotation Some of the leastwanted stocks
of  have become desirable this year As huge stocks such as Qualcomm and 
Yahoo have sagged smaller
onceneglected SP companies such as Reebok and Allied Waste have soared 

The switch can be seen in an index called the Value Line Arithmetic Index 
That index tracks about 
companies and doesnt give any extra weight to the ones with a larger market 
value It is a closer reflection of the
average company rather than the biggest companies 

So far this year it is up  eclipsing the SP  The SP  is 
weighted according to its members market
value which means that it is dominated by the larger stocks The Value Line 
indexs strength compared with the
SP  is a clear indication that some of the smaller stocks are making a 
comeback at least for now 

Some of the gains do seem to reflect special circumstances Utilities have 
been helped by an explosion in
naturalgas prices and by a search for stable investments in a turbulent 
stock market Many banks and brokerage
firms have benefited from takeover speculation Merrill Lynch is up  so 
far this year Lehman Brothers is up
 

If takeover expectations fade the brokerage stocks risk a slide And energy 
companies depend on oil and gas
prices which can make them volatile Naturalgas bulls note however that 
naturalgas prices are expected to
remain high for some time which could keep propelling that group ahead 

Very few people thought energy prices would remain this high for as long as 
they have notes Donaldson Lufkin 
Jenrette investment strategist Thomas Galvin So you still have people 
underweighted both areas energy and
utilities 

That means that there still are plenty of skeptics out there If gas prices 
stay high the stocks have room to rise as
skeptics are won over 

But the real trick during the coming months may not be to be in the right 
sector but to be in the right stock both
men say 

At a time when the economy is slowing and earnings growth will be more 
difficult you probably want higherquality
stocks because they have more stable earnings Mr Bernstein says 

When tech stocks or utility stocks are in favor it is enough to buy a stock 
from the group and your stock will go up
Now investors need to be more selective 

El Paso and Duke Energy are extremely well managed says Mr Galvin as is 
Enron But the rising tide in
utilities has lifted all boats and not all utilities are well enough managed 
to take advantage of all opportunities 

The key is choosing the stocks that will withstand the more difficult times 
to come and that wont be easy People
who bought Intel or Oracle at the start of this year probably feel as if it 
wasnt that bad a year for tech Both despite
a recent sag still are up almost  this year Those who chose Microsoft or 
Dell however took a bath Microsoft
is down  since the year began and Dell is down almost  

Mr Galvin thinks tech stocks will stage a fourthquarter rally as investors 
look for companies that can continue to
build profits in a slowing economy He points out that analysts expect tech 
to post  earnings growth next year
only a bit less than this years  But benefiting from any rally would 
require picking the stocks that will have the
good earnings 

Another way of looking at the uncertain future says Bob Bissell president 
of Wells Capital Management is that
there could be some unexpected events Companies whose stock prices have 
fallen could be acquired or forced to
restructure which could provide a payoff for investors 

I am thinking of companies like ATT he says Something has got to give 
there The stock is down to the low
s  down from its week high of  Something has got to happen Do 
you fragment the company 

He also points to midcap stocks another of the years strongest performers 
I call the category the forgotten
prince  he says The SP Midcap  index is doing even better than the 
Value Line index up  since the
year began 

Some midcap companies deserve to be forgotten of course But the index also 
contains some smaller banks that
could be takeover targets and it has some fastgrowing tech companies too 
It is getting stronger as the
technological revolution moves companies rapidly from smallcap to midcap 
Mr Bissell says 

 

Fridays Market Activity 

Soaring energy prices knocked market averages sharply lower 

American Express lost  to  Chase Manhattan dropped  to  
and General Electric which has an
exposure to the group through its financialservices operations gave up  
to  

The group also suffered from a cooling in takeover speculation Lehman 
Brothers for example fell  to 
Goldman Sachs lost  to  and Bear Stearns gave up  to  

Higher oil prices helped Exxon Mobil rise  to  It reached a week 
high its first since Dec  while
Amerada Hess climbed  to  and touched a week high of its own 

Database software company Oracle Nasdaq fell  to  with  million 
shares changing hands Despite
Oracles announcement of strong quarterly earnings Thursday after the end of 
normal trading some analysts said
they were disappointed with the companys revenue growth 

Siebel Systems Nasdaq an Oracle competitor added  to  However i 
Technologies fell  to

Red Hat Nasdaq lost  to  The Research Triangle Park NC

The Gore and Bush campaigns will argue over which did better in the debate 
over debates but one winner is clear
PBS news anchor Jim Lehrer Not only will he moderate all three presidential 
debates sponsored by the bipartisan
Commission on Presidential Debates but under an agreement completed over 
the weekend he will do so under
rules giving him more flexibility than ever before He will be free to bore 
in on a specific subject and extend
discussion of it rather than simply move on to other questions as in the 
past Under the debate agreement the two
candidates will stand behind lecterns at the opening debate Oct  sit 
around a table in talkshow fashion on Oct
 and debate in a townhall format on Oct  

In other campaign developments

 Housing policy In the closest thing yet to a campaign debate on housing 
issues the Republican partys Web
site is trying to entice listeners to dial in to radio talk shows and charge 
that Democrats are running The Slumlord
Ticket Why On top of a recent controversy over complaints by tenants of a 
rental house in Tennessee owned by
Vice President Gore the Web site touts the story of a similar headache now 
faced by running mate Joseph
Lieberman An immigrant mother was evicted when she was injured and fell 
behind in rent payments at a property
owned by the estate of Mr Liebermans wealthy late uncle Mr Lieberman is 
executor of the estate 

 A fish story To the list of the perils of holding public office now add 
the danger of flying fish Just ask Rep Helen
ChenowethHage an Idaho Republican who was pelted with rotting salmon 
thrown by a yearold protester at a
hearing on Western wildfires held in Montana over the weekend The protester 
cried out that the conservative
congresswoman is the greatest threat to the forest and uncorked the salmon 
She wasnt hurt but the Associated
Press reports that the hearing was recessed while she cleaned salmon from 
her hair and jacket

GE Tops Fortunes Ranking of the Worlds Most Admired Companies Key To 
Staying Ahead of the Pack Is Innovation

  
Business Wire
Copyright c  Business Wire

NEW YORKBUSINESS WIRESept  For the third straight year 
General Electric on the strength of its
management team and innovative global strategy is No  on FORTUNEs ranking 
of the most admired companies
in the world FORTUNEs third annual list of Global Most Admired Companies 
consists of  companies in 
industries with  selected as allstars for exemplifying leadership on a 
global scale Cisco Systems came in at
No  on the allstar ranking up from No  in  other repeat 
performers in the top ten include Microsoft whose
battles with government regulators on one flank and perceptions of a 
foundering Internet strategy on the other
caused it to slip to No  from No  Intel No and WalMart Stores 
which moved up to No  from No  The
complete list of FORTUNEs Global Most Admired Companies appears in the 
October  issue of FORTUNE and is
available at wwwfortunecom as of Monday Sept at  am 

According to Nicholas Steins article The Worlds Most Admired Companies 
the schizophrenic market conditions
of the past year offer one reason why the Most Admired list looks so 
different this year As Stein writes The
winners are companies that demonstrated a neweconomy style growth strategy 
while maintaining an oldeconomy
approach to fiscal responsibility And as Vicki Wright global managing 
director of the Hay Group consultancy that
helped produce the list with FORTUNE notes There is something new this year 
in how we perceive companies It
is the emphasis on how much companies are capable of looking forward In a 
year when oldeconomy companies
have not seen their share price perform those that have managed to weather 
both the old and neweconomy
storms will flourish

Notable changes among this years Global Most Admired list include Home Depot 
leaping from No  to No 
Toyota moving up from No  to No  and Citgroup advancing from No  to 
No  Strong demand for Sonys
flatscreen TVs digital cameras and PlayStation game consoles helped the 
company move up from  to 
Newcomers to this years list  Enron Nokia Charles Schwab UPS and 
Goldman Sachs  all embody business
strategies that bridge the old and new economic worlds Companies that lost 
their allstar status  IBM
HewlettPackard ATT Procter  Gamble DaimlerChrysler  have been plagued 
with difficulties integrating new
business concepts 

Many of the industry categories also experienced significant turnover Among 
airline companies Singapore Airlines
which didnt even make last years list took the top spot from Southwest 
British Airways hobbled by internal
conflict and heightened competition fell from third to seventh Though Intel 
held on to the top ranking in the
computer hardware and software category Sun Microsystems rode the dotcom 
revolution to second place up from
sixth last year while Dell facing a wireless and PCless future fell 
from fifth to eighth And in the whitehot
network communications and Internet technology sector allstar newcomer 
Nokia edged Cisco Systems for top
billing 

To find out what unique management qualities set these companies apart from 
their peers the Hay Group surveyed
the Most Admired Companies and their less admired peers about the performance 
measures they use to chart the
progress of their companies 

According to their findings Most Admired companies set more challenging 
goals link the compensation of their
executives more closely to the completion of those goals and are generally 
more oriented toward longterm
performance 

To complete the list of the worlds most admired companies FORTUNE consulted 
the experts the business
executives who run companies and the analysts who study them Global 
companies were rated according to eight
criteria quality of management quality of products or services 
innovativeness longterm investment value financial
soundness ability to attract develop and retain talent community 
responsibility and use of corporate assets To
reflect this lists international scope a ninth category was added global 
business acumen A companys overall
ranking is the average of the scores of all nine attributes Companies are 
ranked within their industry and the top 
 the AllStars  are culled from across all industry groups

FYI

Energy Is Hot
By Christopher Edmonds 
Special to TheStreetcom
    PM ET 
URL http  wwwthestreetcom comment christopheredmonds html
HOUSTON  Up and to the right 
That could be the theme of the eighth annual Dain Rauscher Wessels energy 
conference this week in Americas selfproclaimed oil capital Between the 
whispers in the hallways and the bullish presentations from an overflowing 
barrel of oil gas and power companies you might think you were in the 
corridors of some Silicon Valley conference of yesteryear 
But no this is all about energy and energy is hot With oil hanging around 
 per barrel and natural gas solidly above  per million BTU oil gas and 
power stocks have caught fire To illustrate take a look at the chart of the 
Philadelphia Stock Exchange Oil Service Sector Index or OSX 

Up and to the right And a great deal of the price gain is rational As the 
price of the commodities increases profits follow That should mean positive 
earnings from a plethora of oil and gas companies 
While new Securities and Exchange Commission regulations have stifled the 
more explicit now illicit preannouncements at conferences like this 
regulations cant cap all the enthusiasm from rising commodity prices For 
example Kenneth Lay chairman of energy powerhouse Enron ENENYSE said at 
the conference he is very comfortable with analysts estimates hinting the 
numbers are conservative We should meet or exceed analysts expectations 
for the quarter and the year 
Others followed suit Bradley Fischer president of CMS Energy Oil and Gas 
CMSNYSE profiled here earlier  said his company will post record 
production and record income this year because the fundamentals of the oil 
and gas business are as good as they have been in his career Ive been in 
this business  years The first  were good and the last  have been 
difficult Now Im looking for the good times to roll 
And this from Diana Naylor senior vice president at independent power 
producer Calpine CPNNYSE when reacting to analysts estimates in the 
coming year We look to be making that number and look to increase that 
guidance on earnings shortly 
Even the oil drillers and equipment companies are celebrating Nabors 
Industries NBRAMEX owner of the largest landdrilling fleet thinks 
analysts are significantly underestimating its potential Dain Rauscher 
estimates Nabors will earn  cents per share this year and  next year 
 numbers Chairman and CEO Eugene Isenberg called conservative He presented 
calculations suggesting the company could earn  in the middle of the oil 
cycle and has the ability to earn  in the coming years The probability 
of this happening is very high he said 
All because of  per barrel oil and  gas While there is little question 
that third and fourthquarter earnings should be strong there is growing 
concern that the oil and gas stock rally has been overdone Not only have 
stocks tracked the rise in commodity prices but the oncebeleaguered sector 
has also seen earnings multiples expand significantly 
That is a warning sign to at least one analyst While the going is good the 
rapid price rise isnt sustainable Oil stocks stocks will peak in the next 
several weeks and trade sideways probably for the rest of the year said 
Jim Wicklund head of energy research at Dain Rauscher adding that there may 
be added selling pressure as funds try to lock in gains before the end of the 
year Stock price pressure will also be impacted by portfolio managers 
bonus structure 
And Wicklund warned that what he sees as the inevitable moderation in oil 
prices will put pressure on the stocks into the new year Right or wrong 
stock prices are slaves to commodity prices 
If Wicklund is correct the next move could be down and to the left 
The Peoples Court
One of the clever and unique features of the Dain Rauscher Wessels energy 
conference is the annual investor poll This year nearly  investors 
responded to the onsite survey and while the results arent scientific 
they are likely instructive

Source Dain Rauscher Wessels
Investors see oil prices moderating a little between now and December and 
further into next year However survey participants do not see the same 
pattern for natural gas with estimates for gas prices remaining well above 
 through next year 
And what may at first appear to be good news for George W Bush probably 
isnt A sixpoint lead looks nice but remember  were on his home turf 
Texas among his brethren in the oil business 
For W that may suggest down and to the left as well

		 Subject Fiber Optic Public Lands RightofWay Status

The fat lady hasnt quite sung yet but I thought it would be a good idea to 
give you a readout on the current status of the BLM USFS fiber optic 
rightofway issue

In a nutshell our strategy seems to have worked and weve won all the 
concessions we sought  As youll recall these were

a to get the BLM to withdraw any interim policies the first of which 
split fiber cables into  different ROW certifications and a later version 
that repackaged the issue mandating that ROW certificates be issued each 
time a fiber owner subleases or sells capacity on its line with a 
retroactivity clause that added extra sting
b to get the Forest Service to retract its May nd memorandum which changed 
its fiber optic ROW policy from published fee schedules to individual 
comparable assessments the first such assessment which compared ROW fees 
in urban centers in downtown Portland and Seattle to Oregon forest lands 
increased the cost of a segment of our FTV fiber build  fold
c to block both agencies from implementing any proposed or final rule in FY 
 and
d to create an open rule making process that involves all interested 
stakeholders including Enron

Thanks to the considerable pressure we orchestrated from Congress and the 
Administration BLM Director Fry and USFS Chief Dombeck have backed away from 
points a and b above and have agreed to points c and d   The language we 
inserted in the Interior Appropriations Bill which has been agreed to by the 
Conferees forces both agencies to revert back to the published fee 
schedules prevents them from implementing any new policies in FY  and 
forces them to work with industry and to come up with a common policy for 
future rent determination

The reference in the opening sentence to gravitationallychallenged women is 
because the issue still hasnt quite closed  The Interior Appropriations 
Bill may very well be vetoed  But since our issue was settled at the staff 
level and is now off the table were likely to remain safe from being 
reexamined and challenged  In fact any changes would likely only increase 
the strength of our hand some members of our coalition are trying to insert 
even more detailed language in the report that prescribes exactly how the 
agencies will proceed to determine the new rental fee schedules over the next 
 months  Through outside consultants weve had a series of constructive 
discussions with the agencies over the past two weeks that have forged 
agreements on timing and specific ways forward   Details are forthcoming 
but Enron would be involved closely in the process  The agencies were 
clearly surprised by the clout we wielded and are now more than willing to 
negotiate

But the bottom line again is that we have stopped both agencies from 
implementing their costly interim policies or launching a rule making process 
either now which they originally intended to do or in the coming fiscal 
year  And by engaging key Members of Congress and the White House and 
organizing and leading the member  Fiber Optic Public Land RightofWay 
Coalition weve succeeded in branding Enron as a leader in the 
communications field

Attached is my trip report for Amsterdam Paris and London  Ive given the 
contact information for everyone to Kathy to be entered in the database and 
thank you notes are going out today  

The company meetings did not go quite as well as I might have hoped Edon was 
not so interested but we need to discuss further the potential relationship 
with Credit Lyonnais effort to develop the gap financing fundUNEP 
conference not as billed but some contacts there such as Credit Suisse First 
Boston and Gerlings Sustainable Development Company were useful as both are 
quite interested in climate change business opportunities  Also it provided 
a chance to gather interesting updated info on current financialsustainable 
development metrics links funds firms etc  Discussions with participants 
in the UK Emissions Trading group were interesting and I now have several 
working papers on this effort which I can distribute to anyone who is 
interested though Marks group probably has them already but Ill check with 
them directly on that I did not get the chance to meet up with Nicola Steen

Mike  Ive spoken to my contacts at State and
Defense  They both are saying that their people in
Colombia are on high alert  no unnecessary travel
fully armored vehicles when available changing time
and routes etc  as they fully expect FARC and ELN
to react violently to the initiation of US aid later
this month  They believe that the terrorists will go
after easily recognizable but soft targets that are
clearly American  That pretty much means American
corporations whose presence can be identified and who
dont have visible security  The Embassy understands
that companies like Coca Cola have removed all expats
 I asked if the Embassy officers have been able to
move about the cities and they replied Of course but
they dont do it as much as they did and are more
careful now  Cali and Medellin are regarded as more
dangerous that Bogota and US official travel to them
is at a minimum Travel in the countryside is
absolutely forbidden except by helicopter

Hope this helps  Lets face it you can operate
anywhere as long as you are careful  Phil

  Metropolitan Desk Section B 
  Debate on Need for New Power Plants Ignores Conservation 
  By KIRK JOHNSON 
    
     
  The New York Times 
  Page  Column  
  c  New York Times Company 

  New Yorkers heard a lot this summer about why their electricity bills were 
going up and
  why a new generation of power plants was needed and the message centered 
on one
  word demand

  Millions of new airconditioners computers and other gadgets are humming 
blinking and
  draining electricity from the power pool utility executives and state 
energy officials said
  over and over again The  percent jump in electricity rates that many in 
the region were
  assessed in August was only a hint of what could lie ahead those officials 
suggested if
  residents did not accept more power plants in their neighborhoods

  What the public was not told was that the people framing the argument for 
building power
  plants have an abiding interest in selling more electricity Nor was the 
public told that the
  means already existed to dampen demand and reduce the amount of new power 
needed if
  the political will could be exerted

  Before New Yorks energy markets were deregulated beginning in  the 
state required
  companies like Consolidated Edison to reduce demand in the system  
through energy
  efficiency measures for example  if that choice was cheaper than 
building a new plant

  Under deregulation  that requirement has been lost In an open market 
every participant
  wants to sell more energy and the government agencies in New York and other
  deregulated states that once compelled companies to think of alternatives 
have become
  silent or powerless

  The reliability problems and price spikes in the last two years have led 
to a simplistic set
  of solutions build more power plants said Richard Cowart director of 
the Regulatory
  Assistance Project a nonprofit energy policy institute in Montpelier Vt 
that works with
  state regulators and utilities

  On the new playing field Mr Cowart and other experts said the incentives 
are all
  onesided

  Power generating companies have no motive to encourage people to use less 
energy or to
  use it more efficiently because the most money is to be made when demand is 
at its peak
  And electricity delivery companies make more money by sending more 
electricity through
  their wires The incentive to sell more electricity is overwhelming 
Mr Cowart said

  Certainly demand for electricity is rising in New York and across the 
country and most
  experts agree that some added generating capacity is needed And New York 
States top
  electricity official Maureen O Helmer chairwoman of the Public Service 
Commission has
  emphasized in her recent speeches that conservation and efficiency measures 
must be
  part of the solution to rising demand

  The problem environmental groups and energy analysts say is that in an 
arena in which
  government has taken a step back through deregulation  it is harder for 
regulators to
  make those opinions count

  Given the tone of the debate in New York and the sharp jump in prices this 
summer it
  would be easy for the public to think that the regions energy situation is 
worse than it
  actually is Most longterm projections for the region say that demand will 
increase less in
  New York State and New York City than in the nation as a whole during the 
next  to 
  years New York it turns out is not an energy hog

  The most recent official longterm projection for New York called the 
State Energy Plan
  issued in late  said the state could get by with only a very modest 
expansion in
  generating capacity for the next  years or no expansion at all if the 
levels of electricity
  that utilities are required to hold in reserve could be modified

  The rate of growth in demand is also slowing down not accelerating Within 
the territory
  served by Consolidated Edison which includes all of New York City and its 
northern
  suburbs peak demand the highest single moment of energy use on the 
heaviest day of the
  year rose by  percent a year from the mids to the end of the 
decade In the new
  century that growth rate is expected to be  percent a year

  It will be more modest one senior Con Ed official said

  The main implication of those projections economists and energy analysts 
say is that
  most of the increased capacity proposed for New York City may not be needed 
at all at
  least to meet new demand In the Con Ed service area meeting a  percent 
growth in
  demand through new supply alone would require an increased capacity of  
to 
  megawatts over the next five years Developers and power plant builders 
have proposed a
  total increase six to eight times greater than that in the next three years 
alone

  No one plant can make the argument that its really needed said Ashok 
Gupta an energy
  economist at the Natural Resources Defense Council a private conservation 
group Like
  malls power plants are now being built for market share

  Predicting energy demand is notoriously difficult In the early s for 
example the
  accepted wisdom was that energy use would continue to grow at the rapid 
pace that it had
  in the s Academics and utility industry officials said the country 
might need 
  nuclear plants by the turn of the century

  But the oil shocks of the mids and early s forced the 
introduction of
  energyefficiency measures that made those forecasts worthless Energy use 
as a
  percentage of the nations economy called energy intensity began 
declining and has done
  so ever since

  Some energy officials have said the problem of rising prices and the 
overwhelming focus on
  supply is the result of a stillnew electricity market that is not yet 
functioning as intended

  Theorists who had envisioned competition as the door to a golden age of 
consumer choice
  had predicted that companies specializing in demand reduction  they sell 
ways to cut
  energy use through technology or better management  would compete with 
companies
  selling supply But that has not happened yet Part of Con Eds prediction 
of more modest
  growth in demand in coming years is based on the expectation that 
demandmanagement
  companies will emerge within the next few years company officials said

  But state regulatory officials also made the political decision in the late 
s to reduce
  spending for conservation and efficiency measures The state which once 
led the region in
  financing for alternatives to new supply  an effort that included 
television commercials
  urging people to think about saving energy  now spends about a third as 
much per capita
  as most states in the Northeast including Connecticut and New Jersey 
according to
  figures from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority

  Last month a report filed with the State Public Service Commission 
recommended an
  increase in financing for the efficiency program The report was produced 
by representatives
  of the electricity industry working alongside consumer and environmental 
groups But the
  states utilities including New York State Electric and Gas Niagara 
Mohawk and Con Ed
  refused to support the final report because they were unhappy with its 
conclusions

   Deregulation undermined the role of utilities in promoting energy 
efficiency said Edward
  A Smeloff the executive director of the Pace Law School Energy Project a 
research and
  advocacy group that helped write the report As electricity companies have 
become more
  conscious of the bottom line under deregulation  Mr Smeloff said 
demandreduction
  programs have become a threat to profits

  For utilities that buy most of their power from other companies moving 
more electricity
  through the wires has become the primary way to increase profits Mr 
Smeloff said Thats
  the business he added

  Utility officials say that much of their demand problems come down to one 
hour each year
  that moment of peak demand when consumers are using the most electricity 
To a great
  degree planning revolves around the need to have adequate supply for that 
crucial moment
  so as to avoid blackouts But experts like Mr Smeloff say the tools 
already exist to
  dampen those peaks and reduce prices to consumers as well if only a 
constituency
  existed to push for the changes

  Many business and residential energy uses are routine and could be 
postponed for a few
  hours to dampen load on peak days a plan that efficiency experts say would 
be particularly
  easy in New York City commercial buildings where energy use is centrally 
controlled and
  monitored In England one electricity provider created lower rates for 
consumers who ran
  appliances like washing machines and dishwashers in offpeak hours The 
program became
  so popular that power use in the middle of the night went up significantly 
during the
  discountpricing window

  Environmentalists also worry that increasing power capacity beyond the real 
demand in
  New York could create a kind of selffueling spiral If too many new plants 
are built they
  say prices will probably fall encouraging people to use more electricity 
while at the same
  time reducing incentives to save energy or use more efficient products

  In New York and elsewhere in the country much of the growth in demand is 
being driven by
  the spread of airconditioning especially from people buying extra units 
to cool more parts
  of their homes Last year Con Ed began a kind of visual history project in 
which employees
  began regularly photographing  apartment buildings in New York City and 
counting the
  number of window airconditioners In one year the total went up by  
percent

  Some energy experts say more airconditioning could further increase the 
spurts in demand
  that could in turn lead to more power plants which many scientists say are 
prime sources
  of the greenhouse gases blamed for global warming

  We have hotter summers because of greenhouse gases and more greenhouse 
gases
  because of more airconditioning said Joseph Romm the executive 
director of the Center
  for Energy and Climate Solutions a nonprofit consulting institute based in 
Virginia It would
  certainly be ironic if people decided that the solution was more power 
plants

Professional mechanics in all fields who have seen the smaller Angle Master 
all want one We have endorsements from professional 
drivers mechanics and many others 
A recently retired Captain of a nuclear aircraft carrier has stated in a 
letter The use of the Angle Master will 
result in a significant time savings which in turn will increase combat 
readiness of aircraft and ships due to the more rapid 
turnaround of out of commission systems Every mechanic will want the Angle 
Master in their toolbox after they have seen it in 
operation

Gore favors Big Power

September  

BY ROBERT NOVAK SUNTIMES COLUMNIST
Al Gores  billion energy plan contains a  billion federal subsidy to
help electric power companies make their plants environmentally friendly
Therein lies the dark side of the vice presidents brand of populism

The power subsidy proposal was drafted by a Washington energy consultant who
is one of Gores closest advisers on the environment One of the major
beneficiaries of the plan would be a power company notorious for polluting
the atmosphere To close the circle the company has used the Gore adviser
as a paid consultant

In polishing up his energy program Gore played a variation on his Los
Angeles acceptance speechs populistic attack on certain categories of
business that have broken no law This time the target was the energy
industry Big Oil assailed for benefitting from the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries manipulation of oil prices But Gore is no
acrosstheboard enemy of corporate America He always takes care of
friends While positioning himself as the foe of Big Oil he emerges as the
friend of Big Power

In that category is American Electric Power based in Columbus Ohio and
one of the Midwests biggest supplier of coalgenerated power AEP sued by
the Environmental Protection Agency last year for alleged violation of the
Clear Air Act is widely viewed as a pariah by the environmentalist
movement It is accused of running one of the dirtiest operations to
generate power

AEP frequently has paid for advice from environmental advocate Kathleen A
McGinty who has an unusual resume indeed As senior legislative assistant
for energy and environmental policy to thenSen Albert Gore Jr of
Tennessee she quickly gained a reputation on Capitol Hill as a passionate
advocate for global climate control

Gore picked her for Clinton administration posts enabling her to affect
national policy in a major way In  she was named to head the new White
House Office on Environmental Policy In  she was promoted to head the
Council on Environmental Quality and became a leader in trying to sell to
America the massively unpopular  Gorepromoted Kyoto Treaty never
considered by the Senate to slash energy consumption

Last year McGinty emerged as a consultant with the law and lobbying firm of
Troutman Sanders There she has been engaged in an interesting balancing
act On the one hand she advised AEP and the Atlantabased Southern Co
another power giant On the other she moonlighted for Gore in drafting the
June  energy plan Since July she has been working full time for the
Democratic National Committee

Gores plan promises to clean up the nations aging power plants by using
marketbased enforcement and comprehensive standards to reduce pollution and
increase efficiency It offers a menu of financial mechanisms to those
power plants and industries that come forward with projects that promise to
dramatically reduce climate and healththreatening pollution

That means a big subsidy for electric power companies to help them clean up
their plants According to congressional energy sources AEP would receive
millions of dollars to get right environmentally

Gore always has shown ability to reward individual corporate friends while
castigating big business as predators I previously reported that he had
supported permission for deep oil and gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico
desired only by Occidental Petroleum Corp the source of much of his
familys wealth

But federal help for Occidental and American Power and the potential for
conflicts of interest fly beneath the radar in a capital where the hands of
neither political party are clean It is possible for Gores diluted brand
of populism to flourish because it is the way Washington works

California Utilities LossesOn Electricity Pose Risk

By REBECCA SMITH

Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

Californias two biggest utilities are losing so much
money buying electricity in the states deregulated
market that they have run up deficits equivalent to half
their net worth in just four months

If the cost of wholesale power continues to exceed the
price these utilities are allowed to bill their
customers as currently seems likely they could become
technically insolvent sometime next year That would put
pressure on regulators to orchestrate a
multibilliondollar public bailout similar to the too
big to fail response that in the past pushed
governments to rescue banks

Such a scenario is quietly being discussed by bondrating
concerns that recently reduced their credit outlooks for
Pacific Gas  Electric Co a unit of San Franciscobased
PGE Corp and Southern California Edison a unit of
Edison International of Rosemead Calif Bond rating
concerns say they arent sure how much additional debt
can be borne by the two affected utilities before they
will have difficulty paying their bills

Probe of California Power Prices Begins but New Plants
Arent Seen as Solution Sept 

Los Angeles Utility Is Benefitting Surprisingly From
Deregulation Sept 

California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Electricity Costs
Sept 
If this is just a seasonal aberration the utilities can
get through it says Lori Woodland analyst for Fitch
IBCA If it goes on for six or nine months its a very
serious situation Adds AJ Sabatelle senior credit
officer at Moodys Investors Service Inc At some
point you have a financial crisis

The utilities say they are having no difficulty meeting
expenses and dont envision problems in servicing their
debts But they are vigorously lobbying state and federal
regulators to change the rules of the game hoping
somehow to raise rates to make up for the shortfall The
California utilities experience may be a harbinger of
what could happen in other states where wholesale power
prices have surpassed the amount that utilities are
allowed to charge their ratepayers

For now utilities are making ends meet by going to the
financial markets to borrow money PGE a giant utility
that serves one out of every  Americans is seeking
approval to increase its debt capacity by  billion
It is borrowing  million while Edison is tapping
 million from the commercial paper market This is
going to be a long tough road says Jim Scilacci chief
financial officer for Southern California Edison

Todays situation represents a complete turnabout from
what was expected when California deregulated its energy
market on March   which opened electricity
pricing to competition California tried to give its
utilities a competitive edge nationally by deregulating
faster than other states and by creating a mechanism to
allow investorowned utilities such as PGE and Edison
to quickly pay down debts incurred to serve customers
under the old regulatory system

To do this the state legislature set retail rates at
high levels which at first generated fat surpluses for
the utilities As the money piled up utilities used it
to pay down debts for generation facilities that were
otherwise unprofitable in the new deregulated world By
the end of this June PGE and Edison together had
collected more than  billion and were on track to
finish paying down debts well ahead of the March 
 deadline set by the legislature At that point
rate freezes were to end and retail prices were to
fluctuate with the market

But all that went out the window in June when wholesale
power prices surged topping the rates the utilities were
allowed to charge retail customers Average prices at
statesanctioned energy markets were four to five times
the prices of a year earlier and three to four times the
level utilities could charge customers

The accumulated shortfall has been so enormous at PGE
that analysts expect its deficit to exceed  billion by
Oct  more than half its shareholder equity of 
billion which is defined as assets minus liabilities
Southern California Edison finished August with a deficit
of  billion equivalent to almost twothirds its net
worth of  billion The utilities though they have
been accumulating deficits arent required to report
these as losses on their earnings statements

That leaves utilities in a bind They want to end the
rate freeze to be able to pass on the real cost of
electricity to consumers But should the freeze end
before the statutory deadline of  they get
clobbered That is because they will immediately have to
book a loss on their powerpurchase deficits Whats
more they cant use the proceeds from planned
powerplant sales to cover those losses instead should
the freeze end they will be obliged to refund some of
the proceeds to ratepayers In PGEs case the refunds
could total  million while in Edisons case the
amount is  million

Publicly at least utility executives insist a mechanism
will be found to let them recoup the money spent on
electricity

Consumer advocates are gearing up for the fight Nettie
Hoge executive director for San Francisco consumer group
Utility Reform Network says ratepayers shouldnt end up
footing the bill for a deal cut by utilities that
benefited them before prices shot up

Utility executives are now distancing themselves from the
legislation that got them into such a mess which was
drafted with their assistance PGE Chairman Robert Glynn
says it is best not to overanalyze the old deal
Instead he says regulators and legislators should sit
down with utilities and construct a new agreement since
its in the broad interests of the state not to have
critical energy infrastructure look like a leper

Mr Glynn says the current deal offers mutually assured
destruction to both utilities and ratepayers Something
must be done he says or consumers throughout most of
the state will experience a San Diegostyle rate shock
The utility serving that city San Diego Gas  Electric
Co ended its freeze a year ago and began passing
wholesale power costs directly through to ratepayers
Legislators intervened this summer however and
temporarily capped retail rates when monthly power bills
nearly tripled The utility a unit of Sempra Energy is
also accumulating a deficit as a result

So long as banks and bond markets believe the utilities
will be repaid they will be able to borrow analysts
say Until we hear politicians of consequence state
otherwise our position is that we believe the utilities
will be made whole says Richard Cortright a director
at Standard  Poors corporate ratings group

But that opinion could change if it looks like the
utilities will have to swallow a big loss The result
lower credit ratings that would raise borrowing costs and
could trigger a downward spiral Youre talking about
toprated companies though said Ms Woodland of Fitch
IBCA To get to insolvency a lot would have to happen

In the meantime utilities are doing all they can to
control the hemorrhaging They have gotten authority from
regulators to buy more power under longterm contracts at
fixed prices reducing their vulnerability to spotmarket
volatility And they have petitioned federal regulators
to declare Californias market so badly flawed that
generators should be denied market pricing and even
ordered to pay refunds

Nevertheless several forces are working against them
Although they can sign bilateral contracts prices remain
high for those as well Whats more they cant buy less
power than their customers need If they dont buy
enough the California Independent System Operator the
organization responsible for reliability will step in
and make purchases for them and send them the bill

Perhaps the biggest problem facing PGE and Edison
though is one of timing The California legislature is
out of session until December and regulators havent
even really started to address the issue formally In the
meantime the utilities deficit is growing by tens of
millions of dollars daily

The Honorable James Hoecker
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

Re Electric Power Industry Reform

Dear Chairman Hoecker

We are consumers or represent consumers of electric power  We write to urge 
you and your colleagues to take the initiative to address the intolerable 
shortages and extreme price volatility that have become all too common in the 
electric power industry  It is imperative that the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission proceed expeditiously with the reforms needed to support a 
competitive and efficient power supply industry to ensure a reliable supply 
of power at the lowest possible cost to consumers

There are many actions you and your colleagues should take to ensure that the 
power supply in the US remains sufficient and is available at reasonable 
prices  For example you and your colleagues should remove roadblocks in the 
nations electricity gird  Under the current system FERC regulations allow 
many companies that own transmission systems to restrict access to their 
transmission lines by competing electricity suppliers  The result of this 
policy is shortages blackouts and skyrocketing prices  Like the interstate 
highway system FERC should allow electricity to move from one state to 
another just as freely as motorists do  All electricity suppliers should 
have the same access to the transmission lines in order to transport power to 
where it is most needed

FERC should also discourage electricity suppliers reliance on spot and 
shortterm electricity markets for power supply  Instead FERC should urge 
suppliers to purchase a portion of their power needs under longterm 
contracts  Locking in electricity costs at fixed prices protects consumers 
from unexpected price swings that can be financially devastating

We strongly urge you and your colleagues to seize the initiative on these 
reforms  Consumers deserve a power supply industry that is both more 
reliable and economical 

Very truly yours

Meet Enron Bushs biggest contributor
Pratap Chatterjee

  
The Progressive

Copyright c  Bell  Howell Information and Learning Company All

Copyright Progressive Incorporated Sep 

  Early last October members of the ninth grade girls track team
and the boys football team at suburban Houstons Deer Park High
Schools north campus returned from practice reporting severe
breathing problems That day Deer Park registered  parts of
ozone per billion more than twice the federal standard and Houston
surpassed Los Angeles as the smoggiest city in the United States

  One of the biggest contributors to Deer Parks pollution is a plant
owned by Enron Houstons wealthiest company Enron and its
executives are also the single largest contributors  and
counting to the political ambitions of Texas Governor George W
Bush Republican candidate for President of the United States
Kenneth Lay the chief executive of Enron has personally given at
least  in soft money to Bushs political campaigns He is
also one of the Pioneersa Bush supporter who has collected
 in direct contributions of  or less
  What is Enron And what does it get in return for this largesse

  Enron is the largest buyer and seller of natural gas in the
country Its  revenues of  billion make it the eighteenth
largest company in the United States Enron invests in energy
projects in countries around the world including Argentina
Bolivia Brazil China India Indonesia Mozambique and the
Philippines

  The company has recently expanded onto the Internet buying and
selling a dizzying array of products ranging from pulp and paper to
petrochemicals and plastics as well as esoteric products like clean
air credits that utilities purchase to meet emission limits

  Texas activists say that the tight connection between Bush and Lay
bodes ill if Bush is elected Andrew Wheat from Texans for Public
Justice a campaign finance advocacy group in Austin compares the
symbiotic relationship between Enron and the governor to
cogenerationa process used by utilities to harness waste heat
vented by their generators to produce more power In a more
sinister form of cogeneration corporations are converting economic
into political power he says A Bush election fueled by Enron
dollars could ignite in the public policy arena and consumers would
get burned

  And so may people in the Third World

  Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have both criticized
Enron for colluding with police who brutally suppressed protests at
the companys giant power plant in western India The plants
operating firm is called the Dabhol Power Company From  to
 Enron owned  percent of it with General Electric and
Bechtel each holding a  percent share In  the Indian state
electricity board bought a  percent share of the company which
reduced Enrons stake to  percent

  For years the plant has been the site of many nonviolent protests

  The project has met with opposition from local people and
activists from elsewhere in India on the grounds of its social
economic and environmental impact Amnesty wrote in a July 
report Protesters and activists have been subjected to harassment
arbitrary arrest preventive detention under the ordinary criminal
law and ill treatment Amnesty International considers those who
have been subjected to arrest and temporary periods of imprisonment
as a result of undertaking peaceful protest to be prisoners of
conscience imprisoned solely for exercising their right to freedom
of expression

  Amnestys report found that women who have been at the forefront
of local agitation appear to have been a particular target

  Just before dawn on June   police stormed the homes of
several women The policemen forcibly opened the door and dragged
me out of the house into the police van parked on the road While
dragging me the police kept beating me on my back with batons The
humiliation meted out to the other members of my family was similar
to the way I was humiliated    My oneandahalf yearold
daughter held on to me but the police kicked her away says
Sugandha Vasudev Bhalekara twentyfouryearold housewife who was
three months pregnant at the time of her arrest according to
Amnestys report Amnesty found that another pregnant woman was
beaten and several other women sustained injuries including
bruising abrasions and lacerations on arms and legs

  Amnesty said the police involved in suppressing protests included
the Special Reserve Police SRP on the site of the company It
added The involvement of the SRP in the harassment of protesters
indicates the need for the three US multinationals participating
in the joint venture to take steps to ensure that all the management
and staff of the DPC Dabhol Power Companyin particular any
security staff subcontracted to seconded to or employed by the
companyare trained in human rights and are fully accountable for
their actions

  A January  investigation by Human Rights Watch came to a
stronger conclusion Human Rights Watch believes that the Dabhol
Power Corporation and its parent company Enron are complicit in
these human rights violations it said The company under
provisions of law paid the abusive state forces for the security
they provided to the company These forces located adjacent to the
project site were only stationed there to deal with protests In
addition contractors for DPC engaged in a pattern of harassment
intimidation and attacks on individuals opposed to the Dabhol Power
project    The Dabhol Power Corporation refused to acknowledge
that its contractors were responsible for criminal acts and did not
adequately investigate condemn or cease relationships with these
individuals

  Enron denies any wrongdoing While we respect the mission of Human
Rights Watch we do not feel that its report on the Dabhol Power
project is accurate says an Enron spokesperson The report refers
to peaceful protests when in fact the reason the police were
positioned near our site is that there have been many acts of
violence against our employees and contractors Dabhol Power Company
has worked hard to promote positive relations with the community
Unfortunately the good relationship we have built with a large
percentage of the community was not reflected in the report Enron
is committed to providing energy and communications services while
preserving the human rights of citizens and our workers

  Enron has also raised a stink in Bolivia with its involvement in
the Cuiaba Integrated Energy Project The project is run by
Transredes Bolivias hydrocarbon transport company which came into
being in  after Bolivia privatized its oil sector under the
influence of the World Bank A joint venture of Enron and Shell owns
 percent of Transredes On January   a Transredes oil
pipeline erupted and dumped an estimated  barrels of refined
crude oil and gasoline into the Desaguadero River which supports
indigenous communities such as the Uru Muratos

  This problem is Transredess number one priority and we are
committed to continue to work hard to mitigate the short and
longterm social and environmental impact wrote Steve Hopper
president of Transredes in a letter addressed To the People of
Bolivia on February 

  Facing starvation from the Loss of their lifesustaining waterfowl
and fish the Uru Muratos left their ancestral lands at the southern
shores of Lake Poopo in April and marched eightyfive miles to the
city of Oruro to ask for government help

  We subsequently reached an agreement with them to provide certain
levels of relief and assistance says Keith Miceli general manager
for public relations for Enron South America

  In its actions overseas Enron has made a practice of taking
advantage of corporate welfare And it has enlisted George W Bush in
this effort

  For example in March  Lay wrote a letter to Bush that was
subsequently released to the press under Texas open records laws
asking him to contact every member of the Texas delegation in
Congress to explain how export credit agencies of the United States
are critical to US developers like Enron who are pursuing
international projects in developing countries These agencies
include the Overseas Private Investment Corporation OPIC which
provides political risk coverage and financial support to US
companies investing abroad

  OPIC provided financing or insurance coverage worth almost 
million for Enrons foreign projects just last year according to
government records The New York Times reported Enron officials
have in the past asked Mr Bush to help lobby lawmakers to
appropriate funds of OPIC as well as for the ExportImport Bank
another federal agency that aids American companies abroad

  Enron received  million in political risk insurance for the
Dabhol project in  And it received  million in insurance
from OPIC in  for its Bolivian project

  The Enron Methanol plant in Pasadena Texas lies in the Houston
Ship Channel area the nations largest concentration of
petrochemical plants just east of the city The plant has won
special concessions from Governor Bush allowing the company to
pollute without a permit as well as giving it immunity from
prosecution for violating some environmental standards

  Plants like this in Texas cumulatively emit twice as much nitrogen
oxide a key ingredient of smog as do all the nine million cars in
Texas put together

  Only  percent of the more than  tons of nitrogen oxide
emitted by the Enron Methanol plant in  would have been
permitted had Enron not gotten away with this under the grandfather
clause of the  Texas Clean Air Act which allows plants built
before  to continue their polluting practices Bush extended
this clause under the  Clean Air Responsibility Enterprise
CARE program that his office drew up in a series of secret
meetings with representatives of the top polluters in the state as
Molly Ivins reported CARE waives permit requirements for plants
that volunteer to cut emissions

  The CARE program is backed up by an act that Bush signed in May
 giving sweeping protections to polluters that perform internal
environmental or safety audits The law makes these audit documents
confidential and allows polluters to escape responsibility for
environmental violations To date Enron has conducted five such
audits and filed for immunity from prosecution for violations of the
law according to the Texas Natural Resources Conservation
Commission TNRCC the state equivalent of the Environmental
Protection Agency

  Tamara Maschini who lives about five miles from the Enron plant
is one of the founders of a local environmental group called Clean
Air Clear Lake

  Whole families in this neighborhood have asthma because of the
pollution from plants like Enron she says

  Mark Palmer head of public relations for Enron says that the
companys contribution to local pollution is minimal

  If the grandfather clause was canceled right now we would benefit
the most of any of the companies in Texas because our nitrogen oxide
emissions add up to less than half a percent of the total he says

  Last year the Bush campaign borrowed Enrons corporate jets eight
times to fly aides around the country more times than any of the
thirtyfour other companies that made their company aircraft
available to the Presidential hopeful

  And Lay often acts as George W Bushs chaperone

  On April   he played host to Bush and his father the former
President at the Houston Astros first home game of the season The
game was held in the baseball teams brand new stadiumEnron
Fieldwhich was built with the help of a  million donation from
Enron The company got free advertising a tax break and a 
million contract to supply power to the stadium in return

  Less than three weeks later Lay joined candidate Bush in
Washington DC for a Republican fundraiser that topped all
previous records by bringing in a staggering  million easily
the biggest onenight haul for any political party in history

  Ken Lay is a noted business leader in Texas who has long been
active in Republican politics says Ray Sullivan a spokesman for
the Bush campaign He is chair of the Governors Business Council
But the governor has his own agenda based on what he believes is
best for Texas and for the country

  For his part Lay tries to put his contributions in a favorable
light When I make contributions to a candidate it is not for some
special favor its not even for accessalthough Ill be the first
to admit it probably helps access he told The New York Times It
is because Im supporting candidates I strongly believe in
personally

  In January  Enron pitched in  to help pay for Bushs
inaugural bash in Austin Texas after he won reelection for
governor Today the polls show that George W Bush has a better than
even chance of winning the Presidential election If he does it is
very likely Ken Lay will be pitching in for another inaugural bash

		 Subject Natural Gas Price Increase

As discussed in last Fridays meeting on strategies related to higher energy 
prices Harry asked me to develop the attached projection of delivered gas 
prices for this winter

The projection is based upon EIAs monthly analysis of delivered gas prices 
for residential commercial and industrial customers for selected states 
Connecticut Virginia Illinois and Texas for the  winter heating 
season NovMar  Assuming pipeline and LDC markups remain constant the 
delivered prices were adjusted for the NYMEX Henry Hub projection of wellhead 
prices for the  winter period  A national projection is also 
included

Because the commodity portion of the gas bill for residential customers is a 
smaller percent of the total bill compared to commercial and industrial 
customers the increase for residential customers will be less pronounced 
than for commercial or industrial customers  In addition LDC purchased gas 
cost mechanisms will moderate the effect of the price increase to some extent 
because monthly price increases are averaged out over an extended period  
months in some cases  Furthermore some state public utility commissions 
eg Connecticut are conducting meetings with LDCs to discuss looking for 
ways to lessen the impact of the projected increases That being said Nipsco 
recently announced residential prices are expected to increase  this 
winter over last winter in line with the projection for Illinois

If you are interested in a similar projection for other states or have 
comments with respect to the above let me know

2000-09-27T10:46:00-07:00,"I think its a good document and carves out some solid policy ground for 
Bush  I think the electricity section needs some additions though  There is 
not a lot that the current administration can do about siting new plants and 
power lines  its largely a state and local decision  Further the problem 
has been less about government failing to provide adequate incentives to 
utilities than it has been about a failure of the current commission to 
opening the grid on a nondiscriminatory basis  Once utilities are in the 
open access transmission business they will look for ways to invest in the 
grid and stop getting in the way of independent power producers who want to 
connect to the grid  The answer is open access so power can get from where 
it is to where it is needed  This has been clear for a long time yet the 
current administration and its appointees on FERC have yet to use their 
authority to make this happen  The result spiking prices and reliability 
problems

Ive taken the editors pencil to Dans draft  Heres the result

 Kirk Johnsons September th article Debate on Need for New Power Plants 
Ignores Conservation leaves readers with the misperception that competitive 
electricity markets discourage conservation  True customer choice proves 
otherwise
 My company supplies electricity to a number of businesses in Maine  One of 
these customers is a  paper mill that uses more electricity than thousands of 
homes  When New England power prices temporarily spiked last May we 
actually paid the mill to shut down  which they were more than happy to 
do  As a result the customer made money the grid worked better and 
residential customers didnt hear a word about brownouts
 The financial rewards in the open market create much better incentives to 
conserve than do the bureaucratic onesizefitsall programs of the 
regulatory elite  Its proving true in Maine why not give New York and 
other states the same choice

Subject FERC Presentation on California West Wholesale Market

Last Thursday I made the first attached presentation to the FERC Staff at 
the power marketers meeting on the FERCs investigation of the wholesale 
market in the West and in particular California  Ellen Wolf of Tabors 
Caramanis and I created this presentation building on previous presentations 
by Tim Belden and Dave Parquet  In the presentation and the meeting we made 
the following points
There isnt much FERC can do because the cause of the price spikes is not in 
the wholesale market  We discouraged FERC from taking any action that would 
hurt the vibrant wholesale market in the California and the rest of the West 
as well
High prices logically resulted from scarcity and if the Commission does 
anything it should  investigate whether market power was being exercised 
by any party and  if necessary to protect the market while still 
incenting needed generation establish a price cap at a scarcity rent level 
equal to the price at which loads were willing to interrupt  
The IOUs have not properly prepared for the risk of high prices caused by 
scarcity  They have failed to hedge and have underscheduled their load 
therefore having to fill a large percentage of their load at ISO real time 
prices  My analogy was that this was like day trading your retirement fund 
as an asset allocation scheme
The market would function better if more information was provided to the 
market
The Commission should do whatever it can to incent participation by load
To see the presentation detach save and view in Powerpoint  When you do 
you will find there are many hidden slides that were not part of the oral 
presentation but were provided to Staff in hard copy for additional 
information

According to the head of the investigation Scott Miller the staff got alot 
more out of this meeting than Staffs previous meetings with the IOUs and the 
generators  Based on the numerous phone calls Ive been getting the Staff 
is looking into the data we provided  

I have also attached a revised version of the presentation that Tim sent to 
Scott Miller on Friday  Tims version conveys the same message but takes a 
different approach to conveying the message  On Friday Tim talked to Scott 
and answered some additional questions  Tim said that Enron is in favor of 
eliminating the mandatory PX buying requirement and would like the IOUs to be 
able to buy from Enron Online  He also explained more fully the existence of 
scarcity

Byzantine Practices 
I was flying over Bolivias Chiquitano Forest as I read your article on the 
oldtime gas company Enron BUSINESS Aug  Over the past year this 
forest the largest remnant of intact primary dry tropical forest in the 
world has been bisected by a ftwide gash for construction of a gas 
pipeline by Enron and Shell Enron in its quest for profit has ignored the 
scientific advice of conservation organizations to maintain the ecological 
integrity of this endangered forest ecosystem Enron and Shell decided to 
open the  million acre forest to fragmentation and deforestation by their 
pipeline Enron may be keeping pace with advancing technologies to plow ahead 
in global markets but its environmental practices are Byzantine and pose a

Arena foes launch bid to defeat new plan 
By ERIC BERGER 
Copyright  Houston Chronicle 
Wednesday October  
A handful of activists including a Harris County Green Party official and 
several lowtax proponents launched an effort Tuesday to defeat a second 
plan to build a downtown arena 
Unlike the  opposition campaign this years antiarena movement is not 
seeking a better financing deal for taxpayers These activists want no arena 
at all 
Although this years opponents lack the nearly  their higherprofile 
predecessors spent last year that has done little to diminish their 
rhetoric 
Should we spend our citys limited resources on building up rich guys or do 
we spend it building up our communities asked activist DeWayne Lark 
standing in front of City Hall There will be no more corporate welfare in 
Harris County 
Proarena campaign officials said Tuesdays event which came about three 
weeks after their own kickoff was more notable for who did not attend than 
for who did 
Houston Aeros owner Chuck Watson who funded a large chunk of last years 
antiarena effort has endorsed the new deal Gracie Saenz a former city 
councilwoman and mayoral candidate who campaigned against the  deal also 
supports the new agreement 
And although the Harris County Republican Party  the primary organizer of 
the  antiarena effort  has declined to support the new deal it has 
not been as active in opposition as some of its members had hoped 
In the GOPs stead this year is the Harris County Green Party represented by 
Nathalie Paravicini who said she rejects the argument that professional 
sports are critical to a citys identity 
Arena boosters say a new downtown facility will promote Houstons image as a 
worldclass city 
Civic pride is not measured by a sports team that is ready to leave town at 
the drop of a hat she said 
And organizers of the antiarena campaign also suggested that conservative 
political activist Bruce Hotze would announce plans Thursday to take a major 
role in their efforts possibly becoming campaign manager 
Although Hotze lacks the political and financial stature of the proarena 
campaign cochairmen Enron Corp Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay and 
former Reliant Energy Chairman Don Jordan he comes from a politically active 
family that can raise large amounts of money 
Hotze has said he does not believe government should be involved in building 
sports stadiums but he has declined to say how much he was willing to get 
involved in the antiarena effort 
Lark said Hotze told him that he will actively raise funds to fight the 
arena The group is expected to form a political action committee this week 
to collect contributions 
The philosophy of the antisportsarena efforts has reverted to its  
form when a similar grassroots effort coalesced to oppose the referendum to 
build a baseball stadium which voters approved That underfunded effort also 
opposed any public spending on stadiums rather than merely trying to extract 
a better deal from team owners 
Arena proponents this year have attracted most of their former foes and 
certainly the bestknown to their ranks by altering the original proposal 
which failed with voters last year by  percentage points 
Still they acknowledge that there will always be opposition in highprofile 
contests 
We never expected this to be a unanimous vote said Jordan the cochairman 
of the proarena campaign Lets Build it Together Some people will vote 
against anything 




FRANCE Europe online power markets seen pressuring brokers
By Stuart Penson

  
Reuters English News Service
C Reuters Limited 

PARIS Oct  Reuters  Online trading is set to sweep through Europes 
power markets sending transaction fees sharply lower and piling the pressure 
on traditional brokers industry executives and consultants said on Tuesday 
Scores of webbased trading platforms offering a variety of functions are 
expected to enter the European wholesale power market in the near term 
forcing brokers who work over the telephone to rethink their approach they 
told an energy conference
Transaction fees in Europe are already falling and I think were going to 
see a big decline over the next six months said Gilbert Toppin principal 
of Deloitte Consultings European ebusiness practice 
Voice broking could become a distant memory he told Reuters during the 
Powerisk  conference 
Leading the online charge in Europes wholesale power market are EnronOnline 
which launched last year and HoustonStreetcom which started up last week 
and is already planning to expand into Scandinavia 
EnronOnline is a bilateral market in which Enron is always one party to a 
deal HoustonStreet is a multilateral exchange 
The major advantages for online markets over telephone brokers are seen as 
lower transaction costs and the ability to display a far wider range of 
prices to clients 
Also online trading is anonymous which is attractive to traders said Mark 
Crosno president of electronic trading services at Altra Energy Technologies 
of the US 
Altra is a partner with National Grid in EnMO in the UK a consortium which 
runs a screenbased gas trading market and is planning to launch a power 
exchange 
Many traditional brokers are still deciding how to respond to the online 
challenge 
A lot of brokers are scratching their heads because there are going to be  
or  electronic exchanges out there said PerOtto Wold managing director 
of NatsourceTullett Europe one of Europes biggest power brokers 
Wold argued that doing a trade over the telephone was still in most cases 
the quickest method And that would remain so until voice recognition enabled 
traders to talk to the screens on their desks 
He expected brokers to focus on longer dated trades and options while online 
markets would capture a greater share of trading in short term high volume 
contracts 
The provision of market information and traders liking for personal contact 
over the telephone would also help to preserve a niche for the voice brokers 
said Wold 
The markets are still going to need somebody to massage the markets and 
that is where the brokers come in he said

of   If we do anything my recommendation would be to cut a check now 
for our annual membership the downside of doing that of course is that 
they will hit us a number of times in  for incremental contributions to 
specific events causes

I bring this to your attention for two reasonsone is that if I know Governor 
Gilmore he will probably make a call directly to Ken Lay and you and Steve 
may want to have an answer available if Mr Lay gets the call  Secondly 
what are your thoughts on my response to RGA  My preference would be to not 
commit to any additional dollars with a fall back that if Gilmore does call 
Lay and he wants to respond positively we then commit to renewing our 
membership early  

I think you are pretty busy over the next few daysplease respond as your 
schedule allows  THanks

Steve 

I enjoyed our meeting last Monday and we are hard at work on a different
proposal designed to speed up or progress to the top ranks of the worlds
best business schools As you pointed out this is in our mutual interest as
well as the interests of much of the Houston business community

I mentioned in our meeting the possibility of your joining the Council of
Overseers of the Jones School This group consists of about  business
leaders mostly from Houston but also includes individuals from as far away
as Saudi Arabia

We meet about two times a year for an afternoon to discuss important policy
issues facing the Business School I have found the advice and counsel
offered by the group to be extraordinarily helpful as we work on improving
the Jones School The group is chaired by Dennis Hendrix former CEO of
PanEnergy I will fax you a list of the members and the charter of the group

It so happens that we will be meeting next Wednesday afternoon from three
to five PM at Cohen House the faculty club at Rice University and you
would be welcome to attend either as a new member or as a guest
Interestingly a presentation will be given by a group of faculty who have
interests in the area of ecommerce

I will have my assistant fax this material to you shortly Should you wish
to discuss this I will be here all afternoon today as well as all of next
week

Steve I need your help Twice in the last three months I have run into the 
Chairman of AGA who has taken my head off for Enron not renewing its AGA 
dues I understand that the dues had been paid by  Stan Horton who had 
decided that the pipeline group with INGAA representing it had no need for 
and received no benefit from the membership I guess a few years back when 
AGA kicked the pipelines out they renegotiated the dues into some type of 
sub membership for around K

AGA approached the gas marketing team and talked to Mike Roberts about 
renewing the membership and maintaining relations with his customers and 
later to Jeff Shankman who passed them off to some other person and never got 
back to them as promised  This is a heads up to tell you that Bob Catell of 
Brooklyn Union fame one of Enrons oldest customers and friends will be 
calling Lay

It seems to me that pro rating the dues among ENA and EGM and maybe GPG might 
be a solution Anyhow I promised to pass on the complaint Thanks

Jeff and Tim

Tim I know Jeff knows all about the conference we are organizing and I hope
you do as well

Rob I and the rest of the conference organizers are wondering if you could
help us find out if Jeff Skilling from Enron would be willing to be one of
our panelists He has been an articulate critic of the current state of our
electricity markets and we definitely would like the genco perspective
represented

Naturally we are hoping to get a quick answer because our publicity about
the conference will be going out shortly

A brief description of the conference is appended below Please let me know
if you need any additional information

Thanks very much for your help and advice

SCIENTECH IssueAlert October  
Calling All Investors The New Power Companys IPO Priced at  Per Share
By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis


TNPC Inc parent of The New Power Company announced yesterday that its
initial public offering IPO of  million common shares was priced at
 per share The stock closed yesterday at  per share The Company
expects to receive net proceeds from the offering of its shares at 
approximately
 million exclusive of the underwriters option to purchase an additional
 common shares to cover over allotments TNPC Inca partnership
between Enron America Online AOL and IBMwas formed in late  to
provide electricity and natural gas directly to households and small 
businesses
in the deregulated energy marketplace TNPCs shares will be listed on
the NYSE under the symbol NPW Closing of the offering is expected to occur
Oct 

ANALYSIS I am sure that many eyebrows were raised when TNPC issued the
IPO of its stock at  a figure that seemed surprisingly high for a startup
company that has been in operation only since early summer It is rather
mindboggling that a company with no significant track record could open
its stock at such a price but it is not unheard of In fact TNPC is 
following
a trend of new Internet companies initiating IPOs that are supported by
grand concepts rather than tangible success However the TNPC dream team
alliance between Enron AOL and IBM has been met with great expectations
and a lot of skepticism as well throughout the industry

I read through the S A filing that TNPC submitted to the SEC so hopefully
I can cut through the hype regarding this deal to get to its nucleus First
TNPC acknowledges repeatedly throughout its filing that it is entering
into an extremely highrisk venture and in fact will incur substantial
operating and net losses and cannot assure that we will attain 
profitability
Further TNPC admits that it expects to incur these losses for a 
significant
but undetermined period of time Why then would Wall Street be greeting
this IPO with such a positive welcome One could easily argue that the
sheer market presence of Enron AOL and IBM has by association driven up
the value of TNPC but I think a deeper answer lies within several factors

First TNPC has been bankrolled by some hefty investments In two separate
private placements investors such as Enron GE Capital Equity Investments
and DLJMB Partners among others put up about  million in startup
capital in exchange for shares in the company Enron is the majority owner
of TNPC with percent control This money has allowed TNPC to make 
important
acquisitions For instance TNPC bought the residential and small commercial
retail energy business of Columbia Energy Group which includes approximately
 naturalgas customers and  electricity customers in eight
states This is a valuable card in TNPCs deck as it locks in customers
during this time when deregulation is developing slowly in retail markets
I wouldnt be surprised if TNPC makes a similar acquisition of another
customer base in the near future such as in Texas where customers have
been spun off to energy service companies rather than being held by the
TD operations of utilities In other words in Texas TNPC could easily
buy customers without having to buy wires or infrastructure assuming there
is a willing seller

Second and perhaps more importantly earlier this year Enron transferred
its residential and small commercial retail operations in California and
Ohio to TNPC This deal included the operations of Enron Energy Services
but did not include PGE Energy Services which Enron acquired earlier
this year Together with the Columbia Energy Group acquisition TNPC has
come out of the gate running with a significant beginning customer base
of over  customers Why would Enron have turned over its residential
customers to TNPC  Dont forget that Enron struggled in and retreated
from the California residential market stating that it couldnt make any
money in the retail market TNPCs S A filing confirms rumors that Enron
Energy Services actually retreated from California due to a lawsuit claiming
the company had violated laws relating to advertising directed to residential
consumers in  and  Enron was in fact banned from selling power
to the residential market in California Under this customer transfer
Enron is able to put its money into a completely separate businessessentially
moving this highrisk business venture and worst performing part of its
retail service off its own books Yet if TNPC succeeds Enron still benefits
as it is the majority owner

I think these two factors answer why Wall Street has looked so favorably
on a selfdescribed new company with a limited operating history Looking
ahead can TNPC maintain this comparatively high value of its stock  Well
theres both good news and bad news for TNPC First lets look on the
bright side TNPC has put into place a great management team starting
with H Eugene Lockhart formerly of ATT as president and CEO Other
key players bring retail market expertise from work at MasterCard Exxon
and PespiCo In addition within the energy industry TNPC arguably could
not have a better backer than Enron What other companys touch has been
golden in nearly every venture it has pursued In addition to being the
majority owner Enron probably is also providing TNPC access to commodities
at preferential prices which will certainly enhance its sales approach
in the retail market Plus TNPC has access to the  million customers
that AOL represents which Ive always thought was the companys secret
weapon

But then there are the risks and they are substantial First competition
is not materializing rapidly on the retail side In a state like Pennsylvania
which perhaps represents the strongest deregulated market in the United
States only about  percent of customers in PECOs territory have opted
to switch their provider So TNPC has an uphill climb to say the least
in making any inroads at capturing a lockand making moneyin the retail
market Second the only way that I can see TNPC making it at all is if
they continue to buy customers like they did from Columbia Energy Group
There are big questions surrounding whether the company will be able to
do this or not and much of its success hinges on this uncertainty

Third and perhaps most serious of all is TNPCs vulnerability on the
technology side of its operation TNPC has entered into a year revenue
management and customer care agreement with IBM Global Services under
which IBM will manage the companys online commerce and billing applications
IBMs track record in developing customer care systems is less than stellar
In fact PGE initiated a lawsuit against IBM a few years ago when the
utility had to pull the plug on a massive  million customer information
system CIS employed by IBM which it claimed was ineffective IBM has
partnered with SCT to provide the infrastructure to be used by TNPC Under
an agreement between IBM Global Services and SCT the SCT Banner CIS will
be integrated into a number of backoffice IT solutions under development
by IBM for TNPC Experts in the CIS industry have questioned whether SCTs
Banner CIS can handle over one million customers If it cannot this will
surely limit TNPCs growth potential

Moreover although TNPCs IPO signals a strong future there are many 
uncertainties
surrounding this nascent operation As one of the few major players in
the energy retail market TNPC has very few competitors with the possible
exceptions of NewEnergy or GreenMountain Another competitor is also emerging
in Britains Centrica which plans to expand in North America after its
recent acquisition of Canadian retail gas supplier Direct Energy 
Consequently
the coming year could either make or break TNPC and the challenges that
the company faces in wanting to conquer the retail market are extremely
steep

Spains thirdbiggest power company and Enron Corp the worlds
largest energy trader will invest together in the Dominican
Republic kicking off the alliance by building a  million
power plant and regasification facility
     The partners will build a naturalgasfired power station
whose megawatt capacity will represent  percent of the
countrys current electricity demand said Fenosa in a note
confirmed with the company
     The generator will run on liquefied natural gas when it
starts operating in  switching to fuel from the re
gasification plant when it starts operating in 
     Fenosa has had an alliance with International Power Plc
formerly National Power Plc since  That alliance focuses on
Europe the US and Australia a Fenosa spokeswoman said today
     Enron was the first US utility to receive licenses to buy

EFEN said late Tuesday it has reached an agreement with US energy company
Enron ENE to invest in energy infrastructure projects in the Dominican
Republic
  In a release Fenosa said the deal involves the construction of a
combinedcycle power plant with a MW potency which will use natural gas
from a regasification plant on the island nation
  The MW potency is equivalent to  of the Caribbean islands electricity
demand
  The deal also includes a complimentary project Fenosa said This is the
construction of a regasification plant on the republics coastline with a
capacity for treating gas equivalent to the consumption of various groups of
combinedcycle plants with a potency of MW
  The investment for these two projects is seen at around  million of
which  million could come from Dominican companies Fenosa said
  Fenosa and Enron estimate that construction of the two projects will begin 
in
early  with the power plant coming online in  It will operate with
combustible liquid until  at which time the regasification plant comes
online

planned to really open Petrobras or not  the implication being that we

How can Terry go out with public statements without knowing a thing of the

Subject Re Trade Mission

See below the messages I had asked Terry to convey in his meetings in the 
region  I did ask him to raise the issue of Petrobras through Secretary Daly 
with the Brazilians officials as an impediment to the open markets  

It never occurred to me that he would be making Press statements or that he 
would be quoted in this flavor  This coupled with the GM ABEGAS article 
will turn up the heat

Given that Jims messages are going to be delivered this week Denise Jim 
will discuss the issue with Carraro We intend to file a protest in ANP by 
Friday due to lack of responsiveness in our request for a transportation 
tariff

  I would not go to the press Let it go

 If asked repeat the vision  regional integration based on the 
principles of open access greater reliance on competition and customer 
choice

 Monitor the response Let me know if you are getting unfavorable reactions 
other than Petrobras

 Jim  if you get a call ahead of your meeting  we cannot discredit Terry 
The shadow of Petrobras is an unfortunate quote Use this in your favor 
Press on with the message Is Brazil ready to open the gas market to 
competition If so lets get started

Subject Re Trade Mission  

Terry 

The Key message for the trip in regards to energy should be

 Achieve regional integration based on the principles of open access 
greater reliance on competition and customer choice rather than regulated 
monopolies

The vision is that a customer in any of the countries will have choices 
several competing providers different service options and the providers 
will have the flexibility and agility to assemble an attractive package by 
combining transactions  with other suppliers and customers  This approach 
maximizes the utilization of the existing infrastructure reduces idle or 
redundant facilities and gives customers the ability to more closely tailor 
their energy purchases to the their needs

There are barriers to achieve this vision It is in the interest of the 
governments to work in a common protocol to progress rapidly

Development of infrastructure  Still not well developed Needs to attract 
project financing At this stage the customers have few alternatives 
Government policy should be to allow access above and beyond what was 
initially contracted to justify the financing Terms of financing have to be 
honored Long term competing facilities pipelines refineries transmission 
lines power plants will be fighting for customers

Threat Control of these facilities Petrobras through the BBPL YPF in 
Argentina 

Crossborder Licensing Very time consuming bureaucratic delays to grant 
export import reexport permitting  Present regime cannot accommodate  the 
rapid transaction scenario which will be required to support real integration

Cuiaba Power plant As of today we have not received all the permits Latest 
issue is the BolivianArgentina border dispute due to YPF denial to 
accommodate a transaction of Bolivian gas into Argentina

Operationally the plant will receive daily instructions from Brasilia The 
gas supply from Argentina Bolivia including spot market transaction  has to 
be nominated within  hours notice  There are no mechanisms to change 
quickly the approved volumes

Commercial entities need to be given the opportunity to export import to 
aggregate the requirements of different suppliers various customers

Taxation Transfer taxes ie receipt taxes stamp taxes for each step 
down the chain needs to be eliminated for commercial entities particularly 
for export transactions

These commercial entities buy pieces of the services on behalf of the 
ultimate customer act as their agent and package the final offer The 
objective to  reduce the cost of the product which would not be met by 
adding a further taxable event There should not be  more nor any less taxes 
because of the services of the middle company except for the larger amount 
of income taxes generated by increase commercial activity


Money Transfers  Central Bank Controls to authorize the transfer of 
currency needs to be made more agile Currently these procedures are very 
time consuming and cumbersome Brazil  I am not as familiar with the other 
countries

This is affecting us in Cuiaba The Central Bank has not approved the gas 
contract specifically the Takeorpay provision that has a oneyear make up 
period They want a longer makeup period but that was negotiated with YPF 
as part of the larger agreement YPF may agree but at a higher price The 
Central Bank does not want to send US out of the country so they view TOP 
as a devise of paying for a commodity never received So they are meddling in 
contract negotiations 


Below are other notes

Thanks

Jose

Subject Trade Mission

I have forwarded to you the final schedule of meetings for Dalys trade 
mission  I am very comfortable with issues for Argentina and think we need 
to focus mainly on the stamp tax issue  Secondly I would raise the issue of 
open access pipelines especially allowing Bolivian gas to flow to 
Argentina  The question I have on this latter issue is whether this is a 
matter of changing the law changing policy or pressuring YPF to allow the 
gas to flow on its section of pipe which I understand is not under the 
jurisdiction of Enargas What can the government do

JB I am not familiar with the genesis of this situation how these 
pipelines escaped the jurisdiction of the regulator  If it is determined 
that they are not part of the regulated pipeline network in time a bypass 
pipeline may be built But an immediate solution needs to be developed

In Brazil I am not sure what to raise  On Monday we have meetings with the 
Minister of Development Industry and Commerce and the Secretary of Energy 
and Mines  What do I need to have Daly raise with them in private  Myself 
in public or the Minister of External Affairs

JB For background the Brazilians have rising concerns of the rising 
dollarization of their economy desnacionalizaao Their concern is not the 
US it is control It is that the Oldboys network in Brazil 
Government Industry has been disturbed by the Newboys taking control of 
high visibility sectors Banking telecommunications energy  

Malan Finance is criticized by the clique that wants the government to be 
active in direct investment and support of big projects
Complaints about BNDES Brazilian development bank lending to foreigners for 
privatization Recent AES incident
Tourinho Mines and Energy pushing a new privatization model  sale of 
stock at the market not sale of control to a given company This allows the 
existing management to stay in place 
If it is the Secretary of Energy Carraro his big mission is to coordinate 
the developement of emergengy thermal plants Big Picture Governement Porgram 
 Petrobras provides that gas  Eletrobras buys and remarkets the electric 
energy  BNDES provides the financing   All within the family

Foreign companies will not play by the rules of the old network Enron has 
been actively complaining about the gas policy under Petrobras control

The One Issue I would raise is the lack of competition in the gas sector 
Petrobras control of the BBPL and national gas There cannot be true 
competition in the energy sector because the marginal power plants price 
setters gas power plants

As a note there was a commitment with the World Bank to sell the part of  
control of the Brazilian part of the BBPL pipeline What Petrobras is doing 
is lockingup the capacity long term and building a second pipeline


Of equal importance is our meeting with the Sao Paulo Governor  What issues 
do we have or what do you want me to say to him regarding our assets in this 
area  Even if its to compliment on something thats fine

JB The State of Sao Paulo Mario Covas team are to be congratulated by the 
skillful manner that they have conducted the gradual privatization of energy 
sector  Covas is very influential His current battle deals with tax reforms 
in Brazil He is fighting a system of taxpreferences in other states to 
attract industries which ultimately creates a Federal burden and 
consequently a Sao Paulo burden

The Petrobras control issue of the gas sector should have resonance

I assume we have no key issues in Chile at this time 
 
JB There may be some but I a blissfully unaware of them I would be 
interested on what you pick up

Thanks

SCIENTECH IssueAlert October  
Online Niche Players Capitalize on NaturalGas Shortage Bypass Utilities
By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis


SmartEnergy a Con Edison competitor is offering New York and Westchester 
consumers price protection with the ability to lockin todays naturalgas 
rates for a period of one year In a separate announcement myHomeKeycom 
announced that it will offer energy savings packages designed to reduce 
energy consumption and lower rates for customers in the face of rising 
energy costs

ANALYSIS As reports continue to accumulate that a naturalgas shortage 
will send prices skyrocketing this winter see my IssueAlert from Oct 
 on the subject the most common response from electric utilities has 
been to warn their customers that they will see higher rates over the next 
few months I can point to several examples Minneapolisbased Xcel Energy 
announced a few weeks back that its naturalgas customers could face heating 
bills that are  to  percent higher than their bills last winter Dominion 
East Ohio has warned its residential customers that they can expect to 
pay about  more per month for natural gas from November through January 
And the warnings are coming not only in the Midwest and Northeastwhere 
low winter temperatures drive up energy bills every yearbut in the West 
as well In California PGE warns that its customers can expect to see 
their winter bills increase by about  to an average bill of  compared 
to  last winter These are just a few examples of utility companies 
across the United States playing damage control trying to minimize the 
customer outrage when customers suddenly see their bills double or triple

Along with their warnings these utilities give reasonsperhaps seen as 
excuses by the publicfor the rising cost of energy There is a shortage 
of natural gas across the country brought about by a dropoff in production 
It was an unusually hot summer which depleted supplies for energy Demand 
in general has grown to surprising levels

Meanwhile startup online companies that many of us have not even heard 
of are using the rise in naturalgas prices as a golden marketing 
opportunity 
and attempting to take business away from traditional utility companies 
SmartEnergy is a perfect example In existence just since April   
SmartEnergy offers electricity and natural gas to residential and small 
business customers According to EnergyGuidecom for an average home in 
New York City SmartEnergys naturalgas rates typically have run about 
 per month compared Con Edisons  Under its new promotion 
SmartEnergys 
plan for natural gas guarantees that New York City and Westchester gas 
customers who sign on with their service now will be locked into current 
naturalgas rates for the next  months This promotion comes at an ideal 
time for those who opt to switch as naturalgas prices should begin their 
projected sharp increase over the next few weeks Based on recent forecasts 
SmartEnergy is claiming that Con Edison customers who make the switch can 
expect to save up to  percent on their energy through the winter months 
The startup company also is offering  United Airlines Mileage Plus 
Reward Miles credit and  signup bonus to entice customers away from 
Con Edison 

Based on the available information about SmartEnergy it is unclear how 
the online provider will be able to guarantee the percent reduction 
in naturalgas rates I would presume that SmartEnergy has entered into 
some hedging strategies to minimize its risk in the event that naturalgas 
prices remain high into the next year Any prudent provider would have 
a hedging strategy to protect itself and locking itself into month 
contracts without its own contracts for obtaining natural gas at spot market 
prices would certainly raise questions about the future of SmartEnergy 
In addition SmartEnergy will have difficulty in recruiting customers away 
from Con Edison and other utility providers Many customers still have 
reservations about signing on with an online company that they do not know 
There will be some customers who jump at the chance to lock in current 
rates for  months but many others will stick with the company that they 
know even if their rates increase

I did a quick search around Con Edisons Website to see if it might be 
offering an alternative offer to retain its customers but could find nothing 
that the utility is doing to specifically address the projected increase 
in naturalgas prices this winter Con Edison does offer a level billing 
program in which customers receive a consistent bill amount each month 
alleviating fluctuation in their bills Yet as a utility company Con 
Edison has a standard offer of service that regulators closely monitor 
It is possible that Con Edison could request changes to the standard offer 
service which would likely need to be approved by the New York Public 
Service Commission The PSC could agree or determine that the competitive 
offers by providers such as Smart Energy are a positive result of 
deregulation 
In addition Con Edison could be hampered by fuel contracts that may not 
allow it much flexibility with regard to lowering its rates Overall Con 
Edison probably does not have a lot of flexibility regarding the rates 
it can charge customers thereby making this offer from SmartEnergy difficult 
to beat

The other online startup taking advantage of naturalgas prices is 
myHomeKeycom 
which made a recent promise to reduce home heating oil naturalgas and 
electricity rates The marketing route that this online startup is taking 
is energy efficiencyteaching households how to more effectively use their 
energy and hopefully save money as a result Energy is not the only service 
of the myHomeKeycom it is also involved in home maintenance and repair 
appliances home monitoring and moving services Yet I learned that 
myHomeKeycom 
just recently launched cobranded sites with KeySpan Corp and TXU Energy 
Services to provide millions of local customers with the ability to check 
energy efficiency in their homes

Whats important to note about these two developments is the advantage 
that online energy providers have over traditional utilities As utilities 
try to disengage themselves from regulatorybound rate structures online 
companies have the freedom and flexibility to offer attractive products 
and billing options to customers in deregulated states There are the online 
providers that we know about such as Utilitycom and Essentialcom 
Utilitycom 
has not yet started to sell natural gas although it has established a 
partnership with Sempra Energy in which Sempra Energy Trading will sell 
natural gas in deregulated markets via the Utilitycom Web site Utilitycom 
plans to start selling natural gas by the end of this year but it has 
not developed any marketing campaign in this regard Essentialcom continues 
to open up its service across the MidAtlantic and Northeast regions Yet 
on a weekly basis new startup online energy providers surface eager 
to grab their own share of the retail market 

I also wonder where The New Power Company is in all of this rush to 
capitalize 
on the marketing opportunities surrounding the rise in naturalgas prices 
It would seem like a natural for TNPC to make a big splash with its own 
marketing efforts as it already promises lower prices for both natural 
gas and electricity In any event as the naturalgas shortage may become 
a public relations nightmare for utility companies across the country 
it conversely could work to the advantage of the more agile online providers

		 Subject Meeting w Sempra

FYI  Recently Chris Calger has asked me to set up a meeting with Sempra  
ENAs seeking deals with the two big CA gas IOUs PGE and SoCalGas that 
would give ENA access to their assets  In short ENA wants to offer a 
complete outsource deal for the IOUs core gas load ie rez and small 
commercial customers  ENA would take responsibility for providing service 
for delivery at the city gate and in return would manage all of cores assets 
upstream of the city gate  Were meeting with Sempras Chief Regulatory 
Office Bill Reed and Sempras CFO next Thursday to discuss

Given the fact that Sempras primarily focused on electricity the plan is to 
lead off the meeting with a couple of electricity solutions as a bridge to 
the gas offer  For electricity the plan has two pieces   a commodity 
offer that beats the  cent cap ie nothing fancy and  Deal Bench 
services with the intent of establishing a procurement mechanism for SDGE 
that the California PUC could preapprove thereby eliminating some of the 
immense regulatory risk SDGE now faces

Wanted to run this by folks to gauge reactions  Well distribute the slides 
were putting together as soon as theyre draftedhopefully by COB Friday

Best

SAP Impact  
File names have changed from b  company  rc for MSA booking to s  cost 
center for SAP  Other changes have also been implemented  Please send a 
Notes mail to Bill Myers if you notice any problems particularly if you 
think that they might be conversion or program related  I already know 
about the company description for the MSA spreadsheets where companies are 
rebooked to themselves

Attached  are spreadsheets with the detail supporting the expenses for 
telephones data ports EDI Enterprise LAN Enterprise Help Desk video 
conferencing Internet access email and other services provided to Enron 
business units by Enron Information Services  These expenses are posted in 
MSA Detail Class 

EIS billings for items attached to the room such as phones and data ports 
and people specific services for contractors such as LAN IDs and ATT 
calling cards are billed to the same company and cost center as room rent in 
EB or AC  For Omaha EIS uses a phone database maintained by Tammy Anderson 
for this purpose  

People specific services for employees are billed to the company and cost 
center corresponding to the employees HR company and department Video 
conference usage data circuits Ardmore usage EDI and web site billings 
are based on a company and cost center furnished by the person requesting the 
service

EIS bills services on a one month lag  We take a snapshot of the Corporate 
Administrative Services rent file for each room in EB and AC of the Omaha 
phone database for each room in Omaha and of the HR company and department 
for each employee  This snapshot is taken at the end of each month for use 
as a source for billing information  

Please examine these billings for accuracy  If our billings are incorrect 
generally speaking either the rent should be corrected by contacting 
Corporate Administrative Services or the person should be moved to the 
correct HR department by contacting your HR representative  If the room 
number is incorrect on the phone or long distance billings this may be 
corrected by sending the room number along with the telephone number to Notes 
Mail ID MoveTeam

If you wish to move EIS charges after to a different company and or 
department after billings have been processed or if you wish to discuss an 
alternative to using your HR department for people specific billings please

Subject Re Video Screens in EB Elevator Cabs  

I have arranged a tentative agreement with Bowne Business Solutions th 
floor graphics to provide content digitization encoding and storage for 
video productions  They will have the capability to output from SVHS Beta 
SP and electronic sources along with minimal editing and creation of basic 
multimedia images suitable for the Enron channel  Additional costs would be 
incurred by individual departments incrementally as they produced video 
content for the monitors  Enron would then have a choice of vendors 
including the inhouse graphics group Innovision Beth Stier and others

We also need to determine the point of demarcation for the headend of the 
video signal for these and any other building monitors  I dont know if your 
estimates include any of this headend equipment which would include VTRs 
modulators distribution amplifiers CATV contracts and receivers satellite 
etc  Regardless we need to talk to the folks who will be producing content 
for these monitors to see what types of capabilities they want to have

Finally someone will have to own the channel and preapprove content for 
distribution  Im pretty certain that Mark Palmer wants to control the 
content though I dont think that he wants to manage the production group 
or create any overkill

Id be happy to discuss alternatives with all of you for the content side of 
this project  Again I think that the costs will be incremental expenses 
related to creating content rather than capital outlay

Beth Mark Pam Setev Terrie et al  Are you interested in addressing 
what inhouse capabilities youd like to have with me

		 Subject Commodity Futures Act  Talking Points

Tori  We have contacted Senator Gramm and Majority Leader Armey about the 
calls from Ken on Monday  Because of the uncertainty of the Congressional 
schedule both offices told us to call on Monday morning to schedule the 
call  If Ken wants to make the calls unscheduled we expect Armey and Gramm 
to both be in DC by Monday morning

The numbers are as follows

Senator Gramm   
Majority Leader Armey  

Here are the talking points

 CONFIDENTIAL 

Talking Points on Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 

Background

We have hit an impasse on the CFTC Reauthorization legislation  On legal 
certainty nearly all interested parties agree  However Senator Gramm 
continues to raise objections unrelated to legal certainty for our business  
There are two issues which we understand have primarily been advanced by 
Senator Gramm one on bank products and one on SEC jurisdiction Majority 
Leader Dick Armey is trying to gain consensus with the interested parties 
which include Senator Gramm the Chairmen of the House Agriculture Commerce 
and Banking Committees as well as the Department of Treasury CFTC and 
SEC  Meetings are occurring on a daily basis but little concrete progress 
has been made since draft legislation was released on October      



Talking Points

We need your help to resolve outstanding differences so that the Commodities 
Futures Modernization Act of  can pass this year  There are very few 
legislative days left and movement now on this legislation is essential Do 
not let the Congressional calendar be the enemy of gaining legal certainty 
for this dynamic and growing industry

The current version of the legislation provides important legal certainty for 
all physical commodity transactions not including agricultural commodities 
entered into on a counterpartytocounterparty basis or on an electronic 
trading facility  We strongly support these provisions

The legislation eliminates concerns that our derivatives transactions may be 
illegal or that our online platforms may be unregulated futures exchanges  
These provisions allow our businesses to grow and innovate  Without this 
legislation the industry will be crippled with legal uncertainty and these 
platforms will develop overseas  

Virtually all of the issues in this very complex legislative package have 
been resolved We are indifferent to outstanding provisions except to the 
extent that they impede passage of the legislation  We cannot allow the 
great progress made to date fail in the end

If asked about a possible solution to the logjam  Answer  Encourage 
Majority Leader Armey Senator Gramm and Secretary Summers to meet 
immediately to finalize the remaining issues  Given time constraints if 
such a meeting does not occur in the next few days there may not be enough 
time to pass this important legislation

Note Congress will be going out on either October  or October

		 Subject FERC SEC Update

As you all may know we have scheduled a conference call for the group for 
Thursday Oct   Bernadette called each of your assistants so it should 
be on your calendars

As a brief update prior to our call

We have a phone call in to FERC to check on the procedural status of the 
merger  Donna Fulton my colleague in Washington has many contacts at FERC 
and is working with those people to learn what she can about the status of 
our proceeding  

Joanne is supposed to be meeting with Bob Wasson at the SEC along with Bill 
Weedon early next week to get a sense of where the SEC is on the case

Per Ricks suggestion I have asked another colleague of mine in Washington 
Chris Long to help us decide who would be the appropriate person to make 
contact at the SEC if we decide to make that contact  Chris is working with 
some political operatives on this

We have been working with Portland General and Sierra on their RTO filing  
As you may recall a commitment to join an RTO Regional Transmission 
Organization is one of the things FERC will require of the merging parties  
An RTO filing will be made at FERC on October   While RTO progress has 
been good so far Sierra and PGE have indicated that they may have concerns 
with the RTO they are working with the Northwest RTO  We are working with 
Sierra and PGE to make sure that they do not do anything in the RTO 
proceeding that could cause concern for FERC regarding the companies 
commitment to join an RTO

There was some question about the status of a temporary services company 
being created by the merged company  Joanne has been working with the Sierra 
and PGE people on this issue and does not see this as being a problem now 
but I have asked her for confirmation that this alternative type of service 
company arrangement will not delay the SEC proceeding  I am waiting for a 
response from Joanne

Please let me know if you have any questions  

Sarah

Subject EGEP Sale Announcement

On Friday last night Houston time we announced Enrons decision to sell 
Enron Oil  Gas India Ltd EOGIL our subsidary that owns a  interest in 
the Panna Mukta and Tapti concession areas    We now have bankers involved 
and a data room is being prepared in Houston which  made it extremely 
difficult to keep the deal quiet any longer  There were a rumors circulating 
through the office but the reality of the announcement was still a shock to 
most of the employees in India and Houston  Attached is a memo we handed out 
to employees but basically we said the following
  Selling assets or companies is a routine part of Enrons strategy to 
redeploy capital in the higher return opportunities  The company has 
exposure to a number of tremendous opportunities today that were not 
envisioned even twelve months ago  In line with this strategy we are 
placing EOGIL in the market
  Depending on the success of finding an acceptable buyer for EOGIL  we 
will be reviewing the balance of our portfolio for transfer to other Enron 
entities or for sale as separate packages  We anticipate closing the EOGIL 
transaction and rationalizing the remaining portfolio by March    
  Pending the success outlined in item  we will eliminate Enron Global 
EP as an Enron business unit on March  
  We announced some interim staff changes to facilitate the process 
  a Jeff Sherrick would refocus his time largely on the sale process
  b Mike Stewart will be responsible for all India activity except the sale 
process
  c Steve Harper will be responsible for EGEPs sale activity and 
coordination with our bankers and Corporate Development
  Commented on the potential impact to employees in general terms  We told 
them it was premature to outline all of the possibilities until we signed a 
PSA with a buyer  However in general there is a good likelihood that many 
people will either have opportunities for future employment with the buyers 
or through redeployment within Enron  Those people that do not remain with 
the assets or are not redeployed in Enron will be involuntarily terminated 
March   unless they are needed to close a transaction or to provide 
transition services to a buyer
 
I would like to keep this as lowkeyed as possible  Last year when we were 
for sale there were not a lot of comments but you never know  If anyone in 
the media picks up on this I would expect it to happen early next week  Mike 
Stewart is currently in India in the Mumbai office  and can 
be reached at the Mariott afterhours  He is fully briefed 
on our position regarding the activities within EGEP and EOGIL  Mike will be 
traveling offshore and to Baroda over the weekend and on Monday  I will be 
available all weekend and next week at the following numbers work 
 home  cell   I would suggest 
talking with Mike or I before making any comments to the media if possible

This afternoon I notified our partners and thr Govt of India of our 
intention to market our assets  I will be making a trip to India soon to 
visit with the appropriate people in these organizations within the next two 
weeks  While I wouldnt expect this to happen please refer any inquiries 
from our partners ONGC and Reliance or the GOI to Mike or me  As you might 
expect we want to be careful and consistent in our message to these 
groups   

I will keep you informed regarding any changes to the above  If you have any 
questions contact me at the above numbers

		 Subject Pipeline safety legislation  update

Since the defeat of the Senate pipeline safety legislation earlier this week 
in the House we have been working on strategies related to action that could 
occur before the end of the congressional session  The following 
developments indicate that the legislation is still very much in play but 
our primary concerns are making sure efforts going forward remain under 
control and preventing the passage of legislation that goes too far

Developments

House Republican leadership is not interested in pursuing the legislation any 
further either through regular procedures or as an attachment to 
appropriations omnibus or other mustpass measures   They are somewhat 
angry at the industry for not being able to fight off advances made by Reps 
Dingell and Oberstar who were able to persuade enough Democrats to vote 
against the Senate bill so that it fell short of the   needed for passage 
under suspension of the rules

Senate bill sponsors supporters are extremely angry at House Democrats for 
killing the Senate legislation and at the White House DOT for not strongly 
promoting the Senate bill which they previously had supported and reigning 
in House Democrats   Senator Patty Murray called the White House and 
expressed her concern which prompted a series of meetings between staff for 
Senate and House Democrats and the White House to discuss a solution   

In these meetings House Democrats have proposed adding several provisions 
from the Dingell Oberstar legislation to the Senate bill and moving that 
package on an omnibus or appropriations bill   Sources close to Rep Dingell 
indicate that they really do not want any bill at all and are merely keeping 
up the pressure in an effort to see if they can get the Senate or industry to 
accept tougher provisions

Senate Democrats including Murray Bingaman and Breaux are not accepting 
any possible amendments to the original Senate bill and are opposed to 
changing the Senate bill at all   However Senator Murray and Republican 
Senator Slade Gorton who has a tough election both want to continue to 
pursue the Senate bill unamended as a rider to an omnibus appropriations 
bill    

The White House is looking to cover itself from a poor performance in the 
House and is considering drafting an executive order that could be issued if 
no legislation passes at all  It is unclear what could or would be contained 
in such an order but the White House is indicating to Senate staff that it 
would be more like the Senate bill than the House bill  We are working with 
sources close to the White House to confirm their strategy

Strategy going forward

Upon hearing that some industry associations were on Capitol Hill discussing 
what industry could live with in terms of provisions added to the Senate 
bill I insisted along with El Paso and others that we not take such an 
approach but rather remain consistent in our approach  we support the 
Senate bill and only the Senate bill   It was approved unanimously in the 
Senate and by  of the House and if anything moves forward on an 
omnibus appropriations bill it should be the Senate bill  Consistent with 
what our Senate friends are doing we should not even recognize the 
Dingell Oberstar legislation as a serious proposal nor start accepting 
pieces of it as a compromise

We will be shoring up support for our position of if anything moves forward 
it should be the Senate bill only with Senate supporters and leadership in 
the House and Senate  We will also be working to thank the  Democrats who 
supported us in the House and make sure they have any cover they need in 
case their vote becomes an issue   In support of Senator Gortons election 
troubles we will be working to try to get media placement of opeds that 
support the efforts he has waged and make sure the House Democrats shoulder 
the blame for the bills defeat  In particular we are hopeful that Senator 
McCain who has been passionate about this issue will write opeds that can 
be placed to support Gorton and others in tough races who supported the 
Senate bill

Congress state of confusion over omnibus appropriations bills and last 
minute politics causes the legislative activity to be extremely fluid and 
subject to change rapidly so we will have no real certainty until the 
session is over which now could be as late as October   

I will keep you posted as changes and developments occur

Good to see you last week  As we begin to look for Japanese employees and in 
particular RA GA resources it would seem to make sense to tap into the US 
Graduate Schools eg Kennedy School W Wilson School etc  It would be a 
real coup if we could find an ex MITI employee for example that was educated 
in the States and had a taste for something exotic  It wont necessarily 
be easy  At HBS we had two Japanese in our section that decided not to go 
back to their sponsoring company  Today one is working for BCG and the other 
Cargill

Any thoughts contacts etc

A Trio of Little Guys
Embarks on Wild Ride
In Global Oil Market

Pursuing Business With DOE
Their Paths Diverge One
Leads to a Lot of Money 
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters John Fialka in Denver Alexei 
Barrionuevo in Tallahassee Fla and Jonathan Weil in New York 
 
   
The Wall Street Journal 
Page A 
Copyright c  Dow Jones  Company Inc 
Lance Stroud of New York Renard D Euell of Denver and Ronald Peek of 
Tallahassee Fla all had dreams of becoming oil barons And on Oct  when 
the Department of Energy announced the results of the bidding for oil from 
the nations Strategic Petroleum Reserve they thought their ships had come 
in 
Two of the three black entrepreneurs were unknowns in the industry and none 
of them had ever done a major oil deal But there they were listed as 
winning bidders alongside some of the biggest names in the business  
Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC Morgan Stanley Dean Witter  Co BP Amoco 
PLC and Amerada Hess Corp Each would be given the right to withdraw millions 
of barrels of oil from the reserve amid one of the most volatile oil markets 
in decades In exchange each had offered to replace that oil plus an 
additional amount akin to an interest payment a year later They and the 
other winning bidders the Energy Department said were picked soley because 
they pledged to return the biggest quantities of oil to the reserve 
There was just one catch In its rush to release the oil and so ease a price 
crunch the Energy Department had suspended its usual requirement that each 
bidder supply financial guarantees But it wanted the winning bidders to 
present letters of credit equal to the oils market value five days after 
their bids were submitted The big players could easily meet that 
requirement But Messrs Stroud Euell and Peek were men of limited means 
They needed to find someone willing to back them for tens of millions of 
dollars  and fast 
The drama made for an unaccustomed scene in Harlem where the yearold Mr 
Stroud lived with his yearold mother A heavyset man with a goatee Mr 
Stroud a former Army enlisted man who had dropped out of college shy of 
graduation had held a string of odd jobs while using the Internet to seek 
out a big business deal 
The aspiring oil man had entered his bid for four million barrels from the 
reserve via the Internet He wont discuss the details of his bid but says 
he thought he could outbid the large oil companies because he didnt have as 
much overhead After the winning bids were announced Mr Stroud became 
something of a celebrity TV news crews arrived to interview his neighbors 
many of whom had no idea what all the fuss was about I thought he Mr 
Stroud was some kind of rap star recalls Carline Thomas who lives down 
the hall from him 
As neighbors paused to shoot the breeze on the steps of nearby residential 
buildings most marred by graffiti Wall Street couriers bearing fat packets 
of information spent the week scurrying back and forth from Mr Strouds 
apartment on a seedy block in Harlems central business district 
Inside Mr Strouds apartment the telephone wouldnt stop ringing and his 
mother was helping him field the calls He says he was in serious talks with 
four companies And a movie producer was interested in his life story Then 
amid the chaos tragedy struck On Tuesday night his mother Iris Manning 
suffered a cardiac arrest and was taken to a hospital a few blocks south of 
Mr Strouds apartment 
Mr Stroud said he spent most of Wednesday running between his apartment and 
the hospital taking occasional phone calls to deal with prospective 
financiers Ms Manning went into cardiac arrest three more times and died 
at  pm Wednesday evening 
Mr Stroud was dazed by the fact that what he called the two biggest events 
of his life  the death of his mother and his selection by the Energy 
Department  occurred almost simultaneously Im saying there must be some 
reason Im here  he said later These things happening like this the 
odds must be in the millions 
Mr Stroud wont discuss which companies were vying for his oil but he says 
at one point he thought he had an offer to buy him out for  a barrel or 
 million The most serious discussions began Thursday with a 
representative from a refining company which he refuses to name From that 
discussion Thursday until the following evening Mr Stroud says he was 
confident that the refiner would grant him the letter of credit he needed 
But at  pm Friday three hours before his deadline Mr Stroud said he got 
a call telling him the deal was off I was upset he says I mean instead 
of wasting my time with that I could have obtained the financing quickly 
from some other source 
A spokesman for Koch Industries Inc based in Wichita Kan said it was in 
negotiations with both Messrs Euell and Stroud We invited them to make a 
deal that made economic sense BP Amoco said it also had discussions with 
Mr Stroud 
Mr Stroud now says the DOE should have given him an extension under the 
circumstances If your mother passes arent you given three days to 
grieve Mr Stroud asks His mothers funeral is scheduled for Wednesday 
which would have been her th birthday he says 
Mr Euell ran a small company Euell Energy Resources whose  employees 
helped him broker naturalgas sales and other small energy deals By night 
he worked the phones from his home in a modest Denver suburb calling oil 
producers in Nigeria and energy brokers in Singapore and Sydney always 
looking for the big score that would make him rich 
A friend Norman Early a sometime golfing partner and a former Denver US 
district attorney says the yearold Mr Euell is one of those guys who 
shoots for the stars On Oct  Mr Euell thought he had hit one He had 
been awarded the right to withdraw three million barrels of oil from the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve in exchange for returning  million barrels a 
year later That was enough oil to fill  conventional tank trucks 
Knowing he would need a partner to provide financial backing Mr Euell had 
already placed a call to a man hed never met Kenneth L Lay chairman and 
chief executive of Enron Corp He said he was sure he was going to be one of 
the top bidders for the reserve oil Would Enron like to be his partner 
Within a few hours John Nolan the giant energy companys vice president in 
charge of trading called from London Enron  he said was interested 
By Oct  the price of oil had already fallen making Mr Euells bid look 
generous Still he felt bullish Im betting on Mother Nature that shes 
coming back this winter and that oils going to be more valuable 
It wasnt Mother Nature but the crisis in the Middle East that turned things 
around Monday Oct  the target price for November oil futures on the New 
York Mercantile Exchange jumped a dollar to  a barrel and headed 
higher Mr Euell flew to Houston and took a room at the Hyatt Regency from 
which he could see Enron s story office tower 
By Tuesday the price of oil had hit  By Mr Euells calculations that 
meant a  million profit for him and an equal amount for his prospective 
partner just across the street Enron s lawyers were working on an agreement 
that would substitute Enron as the major party in Mr Euells contract he 
said and were drawing up the letter of credit for  million that the DOE 
required 
Eager to close the deal Mr Euell called Enron trader Patrick Danaher who 
was working on the project I want to sign this thing up today Mr Euell 
told him claiming that he had received an offer from another unnamed firm 
offering to buy his contract for  million According to tapes of the 
conversation provided by Enron  Mr Danaher said the paperwork was under 
way Let me see if we can do that today 
Mr Euell called backed at  am and again at  am Each time the 
trader sounded more pessimistic Prospects were  When Mr Euell 
suggested he had other offers Mr Danaher told him If you have a bid at 
 million you should take it A bird in the hand is worth two in the 
bush I just have to tell you that Still he invited Mr Euell to dinner 
Tuesdays deadline passed without dinner or any action from Enron  While it 
appears from the tapes that the parties had been close to an accord Eric 
Thode a spokesman for Enron s trading branch says At no time was there 
anything remotely resembling a deal with Mr Euell 
Mr Euell got the DOE to agree to extend the deadline for another  hours 
and after a round of frantic phone calls says he collected pledges from a 
group of European banks to support the  million letter of credit But 
when the new deadline expired he still had failed to get the proper 
paperwork to the DOE which then declared his award to have lapsed They 
played me Mr Euell complains blaming Enron for the missed deadlines 
Still he says the experience amounted to an instant PhD in oil Next 
time he vows he will have his own letter of credit 
The DOE said late last week that it will accept new bids on the seven million 
barrels of oil Messrs Stroud and Euell forfeited 
As for Mr Peek he remains the mystery man of the three His company 
Burhany Energy Industries Inc was formed Aug  It employs no one but Mr 
Peek himself Staffers at the Florida Black Business Investment Board where 
Mr Peek works as a businessdevelopment specialist said he had taken last 
week off Shutters were drawn at his modest onestory house in Tallahassee 
Phone calls to Mr Peek were forwarded to an unidentified neighbor In an 
email to a reporter Mr Peek apologized for being unreachable He was 
working relentlessly to consummate this transaction and couldnt entertain 
any distraction at the moment 
On Saturday the Department of Energy announced that Mr Peek had 
successfully transferred his interest in three million barrels of government 
oil to Hess Energy Trading Co of New York a partnership that includes 
Amerada Hess Amerada Hess Vice President Carl Tursi said he could give few 
details of the deal except to say that he believes there was an 
arrangement that resulted in a lot of money for Mr Peek

DEAL OF THE WEEK Artesia Seeks a Link To Information Firms

Copyright  The Washington Post Co All Rights Reserved 
Rockvillebased Artesia Technologies wasnt just interested in another 
venture capital investment It wanted partners 
In its recent  million funding the digital asset management companys 
second round its venture capital lead was joined by a group of strategic 
partners 
Artesia wanted to form relationships with other information management 
companies instead of working only with banks or venture capital firms We 
wanted to make it more of a partnership with other companies said Brian 
Hedquist Artesias marketing communications manager 
For example in September Vignette Corp of Austin announced an agreement 
with Artesia to create an Internet commerce application Now with Vignettes 
investment the relationship is strengthened Its not a pure financial 
investment said Hedquist of the equity stake Vignette and the other 
strategic partners have in Artesia They have a vested interest Were all 
going to benefit 
Artesia was born last year in a managementled buyout with the help of  
million from Warburg Pincus 
CEO Chris Veator created the company when he and a group of insiders led a 
buyout of the information management division of Bostonbased financial 
information giant Thomson Financial Corp 
Veators idea was to jump into digital asset management for a broad array of 
clients not just managing information for publishing companies and new 
organizations 
We found very quickly Veator said that the real opportunity was not just 
in the publishing community 
Company officials said the funding will help Artesia pursue more 
international expansion opportunities the primary focus of which will be 
Europe where Artesia opened a London office last June Also the financing 
will be used to increase the sales and marketing staff Veator expects the 
staff to double and revenue to triple over the next  months though he 
declined to give any financial information

Oct   PM
What public gets is at heart of arena issue 
By ERIC BERGER 
Copyright  Houston Chronicle 
When Enron Field opened this spring the Astros boasted to fans that they 
were playing baseball the way it was meant to be  on real grass under the 
open sky 
Blocks away the Rockets and most of the citys political and business elite 
are asking voters for a new basketball arena 
Yet if voters approve the construction in the Nov  election the game 
still would be played indoors on a hardwood floor An arena is after all an 
arena and basketball already is played in Houston the way it was meant to 
be 
The team points to such fan benefits as a flashier show with modern video 
and sound equipment and a more competitive team funded by higher revenues 
The arenas influential backers say an arena would spur downtown development 
strengthen the economy and help affirm Houstons position as a worldclass 
city 
For nonfans its difficult to predict how many of these benefits an arena 
actually would generate More calculable is the financial effect it would 
have on Rockets owner Leslie Alexander and to a lesser extent the city of 
Houston 
Compared with his barebones lease at Compaq Center Alexander and the  
players who wear his uniform stand to benefit greatly 
Based on estimates from other new arenas Alexander stands to reap  
million to  million more a year were he to go from being a tenant at 
Compaq Center to being landlord of a new arena For about  million a year 
Alexander would enjoy revenue from such sources as  luxury suites premium 
club seating near the court selling the buildings name and even bestowing 
upon Miller Coors or some other brewer the right to sell  beers 
Granted going from tenant to landlord would boost his costs Less the rent 
he now pays at Compaq Center Alexander would spend  million to  million 
a year to keep the lights on 
For players theres no such overhead They would share the windfall Under 
the collective bargaining agreement ratified in January  most revenues 
collected by NBA owners are stirred into a mythical pot out of which  
percent is divided by the number of teams to determine a salary cap 
For the citys part it would spend less money buying and preparing land for 
the arena under this years deal with expenses capped at  million A 
different location chosen in last years plan would have cost the city at 
least  million more 
Both this year and last the city was to own the land and arena after  
years Now the city would get a parking garage too 
In the revised agreement the city also would receive  a year use of 
the arena for conventionrelated events or fundraisers on  days a year 
and a suite between the freethrow lines 
Its a much better deal for Houston says Mayor Lee Brown who as a chief 
negotiator and supporter of the previous deal is among the least likely to 
make such admissions 
City officials have valued the suite at  to  because it would 
allow Houston to woo convention center customers The Rockets plan to sell 
the suites for  to  each 
The suite actually could cost more than it is worth if the city opts to cater 
games for visitors This year the sports authority spent about  on 
food for about  dates at Enron Field There would be at least twice as many 
events in the arena 
The public would make its greatest contribution through the Harris 
CountyHouston Sports Authority 
That board would sell bonds to cover the arenas  million design and 
construction cost Appointed by the city and county to collect hotel and car 
rental taxes to finance stadium construction the member sports authority 
also would repay a  million loan  interestfree for the first five years 
 from business leaders earmarked for a parking garage 
What does the public get in return 
Something much bigger said Ken Lay cochairman of the proarena campaign 
Its making Houston Texas and particularly downtown a much more viable 
economic area Making it more attractive for business to come to town making 
it more attractive for conventions to come to town and making it more 
attractive for the best and brightest talent in the world to come here and 
work with us 
Moreover supporters say a downtown arena with its advanced sound and video 
systems wider concourses scores of restrooms and a constellation of 
eateries would be like going from a phonograph to a hifi stereo 
Some longtime Compaq Center patrons who have visited new arenas agree 
When people go to Enron Field theyve had an experience said fan Rebecca 
Tonahill  who attends a couple of dozen Rockets and Comets games a year 
and has traveled to Los Angeles and Indianapolis arenas that opened last 
year You dont get an experience at Compaq Center but I think they could 
capture some of that with the new arena 
Overall analyses of the deals bottomline cost vary by how much the sports 
authority loses if anything from building the parking garage 
Harris County Tax AssessorCollector Paul Bettencourt calculates the Rockets 
would pay only  percent of the arenas total cost which comes to  
million by his tally and the public would pay the remainder Ric Campo the 
sports authoritys financial whiz contends the teams contribution would be 
closer to half of the  million he estimates as the total cost 
Depending on how the numbers are manipulated both are right 
Bettencourt believes the public would pay the parking garages entire  
million cost 
A sore spot among tax watchdogs has been the sports authority building a 
garage that Alexander will have exclusive profit from during his events 
including games involving the Rockets and Comets basketball teams and 
ThunderBears arena football team 
Still said Campo the sports authority has use of the garage at all other 
times which he says would be enough to cover annual garage payments The 
private loan is interestfree for the first five years which would save  
million 
What is clear is that taxpayers would spend between  million and  
million to build an arena that would create wealth for a few Arena opponents 
call it corporate welfare Supporters say its a good investment 
It has happened before to an even greater extent with the construction of 
Enron Field for Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr and the football stadium for 
Houston Texans owner Bob McNair 
This point always raises serious questions about balance in peoples minds 
said Dennis Howard a sports marketing professor at the University of Oregon 
Those paying the greatest share are not getting the benefit They often 
cant even afford to go 
The counterargument from arena supporters is that visitors pay most hotel 
and car rental taxes Bettencourt has studied the issue and concluded that 
locals pay at least  percent of the visitor taxes 
Howards research suggests about one of every  people who live in a market 
where a majorleague sports team gets a new building ends up using the 
facility in a given year However the study did not differentiate arenas 
from football or baseball stadiums Arenas probably would attract more people 
because of the many nonsporting events held there 
Not only do fans pay for the building with taxes they are hit again by more 
expensive tickets said Howard noting that average ticket prices jump by  
to  percent in a new building 
The Rockets disputed that citing a study of six recently opened arenas where 
prices jumped from  to  percent The teams chief operating officer 
George Postolos said the Rockets have not raised the price of the most 
affordable tickets in five years He said the team would remain committed to 
keeping a comparable number of affordable seats in a new arena 
Customers buying expensive tickets typically corporations would feel the 
bulk of the increase 
Premium seat holders get more in a new building he said and they pay 
more for it 
Houston voters at least have a fairly clear idea of who is getting what in 
this deal Its all right there on the table notes Bob Eury president of 
Central Houston Inc 
That is not always the case when teams and governments are eager 
collaborators in search of public support In Indianapolis for instance 
local media suggested the agreement to build the  million Conseco 
Fieldhouse involved  million in private money and  million in public 
money One reporter writing in the Indianapolis Stars special arenaopening 
section went as far as to write This isnt Houston or Hartford Conn or 
those other cities that swung open the public vault when it came time to pony 
up for new sports facilities 
An arena built with less public than private money in such a small market 
would be something worth bragging about 
The reality in the bond documents is much different The citys capital 
improvement board sold  million worth of bonds to finance the arena and 
a parking garage Those bonds will be repaid by a dizzying array of taxes 
including a cigarette tax carrental tax hotel tax a tax on goods sold at 
the arena and a diversion of state income taxes on players salaries 
The private contributions come from  million worth of donated land a  
million loan to be repaid by the city and as touted by the Star  
million from the Pacers basketball team 
But the Pacers contribution is made up almost entirely of revenues the 
city expects to generate from the arenas publicly financed parking garage 
when the team is not using it according to an attorney who worked on the 
bond sale 
Advertising for the arena in Houston so far has been accurate but there are 
two sides to some of the numbers presented 
A common claim is that the Rockets would pay  million a year in rent 
appearing most recently in an Oct  opinion piece by sports authority 
Chairman Billy Burge This implies that more than half the  million to  
million the sports authority would pay on its arena debt each year would come 
from the Rockets 
Actually of this rent  million would be put into a fund for major 
arena repairs Another  million would be paid to the sports authority 
but if the sports authority could pay its annual debts the money would be 
refunded to the Rockets The sports authority would have enough money to pay 
its debt on three stadiums if its tax revenues rise at  percent They have 
grown at around  percent in recent years 
Finally another  of the rent is paid to the city 
Boosters also commonly promote arenas to voters as engines of economic 
development generating millions of dollars in sales taxes 
But even if the teams left most personal leisure spending would simply be 
spent on movies the arts or other forms of entertainment said John 
Siegfried a Vanderbilt University economics professor 
The other major chunk from sales taxes on corporate spending at the arenas 
often comes from advertising budgets he said and there are other 
promotional activities where the money could be spent 
Repeatedly were finding the emperor has no clothes said Howard of 
Oregon These buildings are sold as economic development engines but the 
economic impact they create is negligible 
Studies by professional consultants may and often do find otherwise but 
they are usually commissioned by a team or government seeking to justify 
public spending on a new facility Siegfried said 
Campo countered that building Enron Field has already fueled local economic 
gain from higher property tax revenues The ballparks  blocks of land were 
purchased at  per square foot he said A single block across the street 
was recently sold for  a square foot to Trammel Crow 
Land values around the arena site have likewise doubled within the last year 
on speculation of development there 
Thats creating a lot of value for the city county and schools Campo 
said 
Economists including four interviewed for this article argue that spending 
public money in other ways such as tax abatements to developers would 
stimulate even more activity They point to research in respected economic 
journals that has found higher high school graduation rates and more spending 
on police encouraged economic growth whereas a majorleague sports team 
actually put a drag on the economy 
By Texas law the sports authority may not spend the taxes it collects on a 
venue unless it is approved by voters and it may spend its revenue only on 
sports facilities or other community projects like an arts center 
Its  percent hotel tax and  percent car rental tax will not rise if the 
arena proposition passes Adding arena payments to its existing debt would 
completely tap its resources however 
The board has not addressed what to do if the arena fails To spend money on 
anything other than an approved venue such as hospitals or schools as 
opponents suggest would require legislative action

FOR ARENA   Many concrete reasons to support this proposal Nov

Houstonians are no strangers to the many arguments for and against the 
building of new sports arenas Weve hashed and rehashed them often in the 
past few years Weve put one facility  Enron Field for baseball downtown  
on the map and were erecting another  a new football rodeo stadium at the 
site of the Astrodome 
A decision on a third piece  a downtown basketball hockey arena  is 
forthcoming on the Nov  election ballot
The Chronicle urges voters to vote for the arena referendum 
It makes sense for Houston to finish the third leg of this sports facility 
package as both a qualityoflife amenity and a valuable economic development 
tool 
The arena proposal is essentially the same one in terms of financing as the 
others that were approved by voters in  Tax dollars will be spent 
sparingly taxpayer liability is limited and taxpayers are even protected 
from having to pick up cost overruns 
The fact there is a relative consensus on the proposal or at least a lack of 
vigorous opposition as there was on a previous proposal is a signal that 
this deal is a better one for Houston The buildings tenants the Houston 
Rockets and Comets are paying a fair share of the costs 
Ticket and parking taxes have been eliminated from the new proposal 
Many people find the corporate welfare aspect of publicly financed arenas 
distasteful and some of their concerns have merit But the reality is that 
major league sports teams are amenities that help cities and all of their 
residents Thats part of the reason so many cities compete to have them and 
retain them 
Houstonians have debated this issue for years and some people will adhere 
no matter what to the philosophy that sports teams shouldnt be publicly 
subsidized Continued debate wont change their minds 
We believe the presence of sports teams and facilities such as these is a 
plus for the city that far outweighs the public costs 
Its not an esoteric theoretical discussion The proof is concrete  as 
concrete as the  new projects developed in downtown around Enron Field 
They include a mix of residential office and entertainment facilities 
totaling about  million 
The economic activity these enterprises generate is already a boon to 
Houstons economy The property value they add to the tax rolls will more 
than offset the public investment costs of Enron Field 
Some critics of the arena have posited the theory that funds needed for 
public safety such as improvements to the Fire Department will be raided or 
shortchanged by the citys commitment to the arena But thats simply not the 
case The increased property taxes and other benefits of a more dynamic 
downtown will repay the citys investment many times over Thats new tax 
money available to the citys general fund which pays for police and fire 
protection So its not an eitheror decision 
Furthermore what the stadium and all this activity have done for downtown 
and for Houstons image as a whole is quite remarkable 
Remember downtowns northeast quadrant was was a virtual ghost town of 
dilapidated warehouses and empty fields only a few months ago Enron Field 
coupled with Theater District development and other projects has put to rest 
almost every argument that was made against the building of that stadium 
A downtown arena would help complete the renaissance of the area and would 
put money into the public coffers 
These are all strong reasons to vote enthusiastically for the arena proposal 
on Nov

A
Is new arena deal a slamdunk for taxpayers   Houstons costs funding for 
NBA team compared to other cities

Those who support subsidizing an arena to keep the Houston Rockets in Space 
City hail the deal struck this summer Its better for taxpayers than last 
years accord they say Its comparable to what the Astros and Texans got 
Perhaps more important they say the agreement Houstonians will vote on Nov 
 is a market deal that compares favorably with other arenas built in 
recent years for National Basketball Association teams
But does it really 
A Houston Chronicle study of the seven most recently built US arenas for 
NBA clubs reveals that four were constructed with less tax money than will be 
spent here if voters approve next months arena proposition One had a 
slightly larger public contribution and two were built with considerably more 
public money 
There are good reasons for this arena boosters contend Unlike Houston 
three of these four cities offering lesser subsidies provided other 
incentives 
In Dallas and Los Angeles they note the government condemned whole blocks 
of land for private development around the arena In Atlanta Ted Turner was 
given carte blanche to develop public land 
All of the markets that received a smaller subsidy also had both major league 
basketball and hockey teams which could share the construction costs Two 
teams generate more revenue which tends to make the public contribution less 
vital 
This is one of the largest singleteam contributions to a building ever 
said Rockets Chief Operating Officer George Postolos whose team is paying 
about  million a year for control of the Houston arena 
Still there is another general rule of thumb when it comes to determining a 
public subsidy Historically the less populous a city and its suburbs the 
more public money is needed to complete an arena project With their bevy of 
Fortune  companies larger cities far outstrip the midsized markets 
capacity to buy the pricey suites and club seats that make new arenas so 
lucrative for NBA owners 
Strikingly an arena was built with far fewer tax dollars in one city smaller 
than Houston  Denver 
Atlanta a market comparable to Houston built an arena with considerably 
less public money 
This was also the case in two larger markets Los Angeles built an arena with 
almost no public money and Dallas expensive project had substantially less 
public than private money involved 
Only two of the cities reviewed San Antonio and Indianapolis built arenas 
with larger public money contributions which is consistent with their 
relatively small market stature 
The arena deal follows the Enron Fieldtype of model said Harris County 
Tax AssessorCollector Paul Bettencourt who released a study critical of 
Houstons arena plan but has not campaigned against it Its consistent with 
how the baseball and football stadiums were built in Houston 
But its clearly not the model for arenas in the rest of the country from 
Los Angeles to Atlanta to Denver 
Conservative activist Bruce Hotze who recently launched an effort against 
the arena says Houston should follow the example of other cities where the 
owners of sports teams  such as the Utah Jazz in   have primarily paid 
for their facilities He characterizes anything less as corporate welfare 
The list of factors determining how far a team can dip into public coffers 
goes on from the breadth of a teams local following to its success and its 
owners popularity said Andrew Zimbalist a Smith College economics 
professor 
But the overriding factor is probably simpler he said 
The best strategy for any team to follow is to ask for so much money that 
the referendum passes by a tenth of a percentage point Zimbalist said 
Teams will get as much as they can If it passes by  percent the owner 
usually a smart businessman has done himself a disservice 
Another big factor is a threat to move 
This has loomed over Houston since NBA Commissioner David Stern announced 
earlier this year that he was certain the Rockets would leave town without 
a new building 
When the Denver Nuggets wanted a new arena in the mids they had a decade 
left on their lease The Rockets have just three years left before they can 
leave Houston Otherwise Denvers circumstances as its leaders began 
negotiating with the team were remarkably similar to Houstons 
The city had just spent about  million in public money to build Coors 
Field for the Colorado Rockies baseball team and was contemplating an even 
larger expenditure to replace Mile High Stadium for the NFLs Broncos 
But when it came to the cityowned McNichols Arena built like Compaq 
Center in  the attitude was that if the teams owner wanted a new 
building he would have to do it largely with public money said Dean Bonham 
a Denverbased sports consultant Eventually the owner got some city 
concessions totaling about  million but paid for all the arenas 
construction costs 
A few years later in Houston after building Enron Field and ponying up for a 
new football stadium public leaders have signed a similar heavily 
subsidized plan for the basketball team 
What was it that opened Houstons treasury when Denvers was closed 
I can sum the difference up in one word leverage Bonham said The Denver 
teams werent going anywhere soon The Rockets got a green light to go 
In Miami a smaller market where a building was constructed with slightly 
more public money than would be spent in Houston the Heats first arena was 
only  years old when the team asked for a new facility 
At first team officials amid threats of leaving managed to cut a deal with 
the MiamiDade County Commission to build a  million arena on Biscayne 
Bay with only  million coming from the team 
But leading up to a referendum a new county mayor Alex Penelas was elected 
in part because he campaigned against public financing for the arena saying 
the county had given away the kitchen sink 
Later a deal was struck in which the team paid for the arenas construction 
and the county bought bayfront property and helped the team with annual 
operating costs 
This dramatic game of building publicly backed sports stadiums with 
questionable public support is so familiar throughout the United States that 
it has practically become the fifth major league sport 
More than  billion has been spent or committed on  built or planned 
bigleague stadiums since  and according to several economists 
calculations twothirds of that money comes from public sources 
In Houston more than twothirds of the nearly  billion in built planned 
or proposed stadiums since  has or would come from public sources 
In spring  citing aging facilities and unprofitable leases the Oilers 
had left town and the Astros were making threats The stillchampion Rockets 
were bound here into the new century but would soon sue to break that lease 
and were making no promises beyond  
The Astrodome and Compaq Center had lost their sheen amid a nationwide tide 
of stadium building that is only now ebbing Political leaders decided they 
must do something to stop the defection of Houstons pro sports teams 
For several months a blueribbon commission chaired by Pete Coneway and Ben 
Love tackled the issue ultimately deciding as elsewhere around the country 
that the city and county should help build new facilities for baseball 
football and basketball 
From this blueprint arose the Harris CountyHouston Sports Authority which 
has helped fund two of those facilities and is seeking voter approval to 
spend its remaining tax revenues on a new downtown basketball arena 
The Astros hit the jackpot with Enron Field which has propelled their 
attendance to more than  million for the first time After the Oilers made 
good on their threat to move to Nashville it took Bob McNairs  million 
and Texas charm as well as a  million football stadium to bring the NFL 
back 
Sports authority members say that if McNairs experience teaches Houston 
anything it will take a far greater investment than the proposed arenas 
costs to return the NBA should the Rockets leave 
They point out as well that in building both the baseball and football 
stadiums although each cost more than the arena Alexander would pay more 
than has either McNair or Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr 
Houstons arena deal as complicated as it appears lacks the hidden value 
attached to some other deals which Rockets officials say makes sports team 
owners in the other markets appear less mercenary at first blush 
More than two years ago Dallas voters approved a  million public 
contribution to a new arena by a handful of votes in a citywide referendum 
A scrappy coalition of opponents which had only  to spend tried to 
point out that the public was giving up much more than the  million 
Beneath that widely reported figure was essentially freedom for the arena 
developers Dallas Mavericks owner Ross Perot Jr and Dallas Stars owner Tom 
Hicks to proceed with an city block  billion overall development with 
the citys blessing 
In January Perot sold the Mavericks basketball team to Internet billionaire 
Mark Cuban 
Perot who had bought the team only four years earlier said he was 
interested in the new arena largely for the related development 
opportunities 
A lot of people look at a basketball team as an anchor tenant for an arena 
I look at an arena as the anchor tenant for a much larger program he said 
upon selling the Mavericks His Hillwood Development Corp retained the 
development rights 
To aid the development the city of Dallas condemned much of the land and 
offered as much as  million for infrastructure work to spruce up the 
property 
The city also let both the Stars a hockey team and Mavericks out of their 
Reunion Arena leases several years early and went so far as to ensure no 
other sports referendums would be on the same ballot Hillwood also got a  
percent construction management fee and Hicks  percent as part of the  
million in public and private money spent on the arena 
Oh sure there were kickbacks and all that said Sharon Boyd co 
chairwoman of the opposition group Its a Bad Deal 
It was like all of a sudden there were five men in Dallas that got free land 
and didnt have to pay taxes Thats a sweet deal 
Like Dallas Atlanta offered Ted Turner a plush real estate deal to keep the 
Hawks basketball team in the city freeing up the NBA team to pay more than 
half the arenas actual construction cost 
Hawks owner Turner Broadcasting Co was given  years to add development to 
the public land the arena was built on with streets roads sidewalks and 
other needed infrastructure paid for with tax money 
In Los Angeles the city condemned most of about  acres surrounding the 
privately developed Staples Center for a hotel restaurants and an 
entertainment district 
The subsidies take all kinds of forms said Robert Baade an economics 
professor at Lake Forest College in Illinois 
The cities and teams have become much more clever about how they finance 
these things and hide the public subsidies

Tonight by a vote of   although Senator Wellstone was asking to switch 
his vote so the final vote may end up being   the Senate passed the 
Conference Report on the DOD Reauthorization HR   With the 
overwhelming majority votes in both the House and Senate this week the bill 
will now be enrolled and sent to the President for signature

Although the statutory language and report language is a clear victory for 
EFS we did not in the end have the draft colloquy entered into the record 
regarding the enforcement interpretation  Seems EEIs lawyers had submitted 
a colloquy of their own  Thus our colloquy successfully served the purpose 
of blocking theirs which we should list as a victory given that their 
colloquy would have been damaging to us  So in the end Enron achieved all 
its legislative goals while EEI was unsuccessful in even gaining a statement 
for the record

Off the record we did gain acceptance for the issue raised in our colloquy 
by DOD and they stand ready to defend their enforcement authority possibly 
at the upcoming NARUC meeting

Bill signature and thus Public Law enactment could occur as early as next 
week  We will keep you advised as to when this occurs  Again 
congratulations to the team for a successful legislative effort against some 
stiff odds"

Reliant Energy Splitting Business in Two to Maximize Shareholder Value
By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis


Reliant Energy announced the toplevel executives for the two companies 
that will emerge from its planned separation into two standalone publicly 
separated companies Steve Letbetter will serve as chairman and CEO of 
the unregulated company David McClanahan has been named president and 
CEO of the regulated company which will be created at the time of the 
business separation In July Reliant Energy announced plans to separate 
into two publicly traded companies in order to separate its unregulated 
businesses from its regulated businesses Following regulatory approval 
the company plans an initial public offering IPO of approximately  
percent of the common stock of its unregulated operations by early 

ANALYSIS In June  Texas adopted legislation to allow retail competition 
beginning on Jan   for the majority of customers within the state 
Senate Bill  mandated that utilities in the state construct firewalls 
between their operating companies In other words Texas utilities must 
have separate companieswith separate financial recordsfor energy services 
distribution generation etc In Texas incumbent utilities must establish 
affiliated retail units that will serve customers who do not switch but 
these units must be completely separate from the TD operation of the 
incumbent 
utility At first Reliant Energy resisted this mandate and lobbied to 
keep its operations under one company Thus it was somewhat of a surprise 
when Reliant announced in July that not only would it be splitting into 
two publicly traded companies but also that it would be issuing an IPO 
for the unregulated side of its operations Currently as one company with 
both regulated and unregulated operations Reliant NYSE REI is trading 
at about    at market close on   Reliant has declined to 
make any projections about pricing of the IPO of its unregulated businesses 
which it expects to issue in early  until it submits an S filing 
with the SEC later this year Reliant expects the IPO to be followed by 
a distribution to shareholders of the remaining stock of the unregulated 
company within  months of the IPO

Reliants motivations to divide itself into two companies are pretty 
straightforward 
On one hand the company is simply complying with the regulatory mandates 
of Texas Yet more importantly Reliant is turning the mandate into a 
financial opportunity by establishing two public companies with dramatically 
different risk   reward profiles The unregulated side will include such 
businesses as power generation marketing and trading telecom and the 
European operations The regulated side will include the businesses related 
to electricity and naturalgas distribution as well as the companys US 
interstate pipelines

Reliant is a company that is seeking to maximize the opportunities that 
deregulation is offering both in the United States and internationally 
As an international energy delivery and energy services company Reliant 
makes about  billion in annual revenue and has assets totaling  
billion 
The companys wholesale energy trading and marketing business is arguably 
within the top five definitely within the top  in the United States 
supported by its nearly  MW of power generation assets 

As the company continues to transform itself from a traditional utility 
into an aggressive energy services company it recognizes that its 
traditional 
investors have tended to be fairly risk averse preferring to invest in 
the regulated activities of a conservative utility company As Reliant 
attempts to penetrate new competitive markets it intends to make itself 
an appealing investment opportunity for investors who are more growth 
oriented and tolerant of risk as described by Letbetter The most 
practical 
way to maximize shareholder interest and boost stock value is for Reliant 
to bifurcate its operations offering two options for capital investment 


Its a trend that is becoming more common in the energy industry especially 
with regard to highrisk ventures For instance Southern Company just 
closed the IPO of its aggressive subsidiary Southern Energy NYSE SOE 
on Oct  Southern Energy a global energy company has become one of 
Southern Companys primary moneymakers in the secondquarter alone the 
subsidiary reported  million in earnings When the IPO of Southern 
Energy closed it brought total gross proceeds and a concurrent securities 
of approximately  billion to its parent Southern Energys current 
stock price is running at    at market close on   The IPO price 
of Southern Energy on   was  Another example is Northern States 
Power now part of Xcel Energy since it merged with New Century Energies 
which this June spun off a portion of its NRG Energy subsidiary an 
independent 
power producer See IssueAlert from    for more information In 
addition the trend is visible in other industries as well ATT recently 
announced its plans to spin off its customer longdistance business to 
shareholders

However even though the financial rewards of such an IPO are enticing 
there are possible downsides to such a move as well Moodys raised serious 
concerns about Reliants announcement in particular Specifically Moodys 
says that Reliants regulated unit could be left with heavy debt loads 
after the structural split which would hurt its own quality and bond 
ratings 
Moodys has put both Reliant Energy Inc and at least two of its subsidiaries 
on watch for possible downgrade from their Baa  status Reliant remains 
on watch for possible downgrade as of Oct  Another risk is that as 
more spin offs of nongeneration units become commonplace they may lose 
their appeal on Wall Street The average firstday gain for similar energy 
IPOs was  percent in the third quarter compared to  percent in the 
first quarter perhaps indicating that Wall Street is already becoming 
less enamored with this strategy

Yet these risks arent dissuading Reliant from moving forward with its 
plan As the company retains but moves beyond its traditional electricity 
and naturalgas distribution businesses Reliants focus is to expand its 
current business portfolio By splitting its two operations in two Reliant 
can separate its vastly different regulated and unregulated cultures The 
companies require totally different management approaches one based more 
in regulatory relations and the other driven by entrepreneurial spirit 
The freedom Reliant gains from spinning off its operations into two separate 
businessesone high risk one low riskappears to make this a smart move 
at least for now

		 Subject FwdFord chairman calls climate change worlds  issue


Joe and Tom  Either Bill Ford is a major Democrat or this signals a major 
shift which serves as a strong indicator that Congress will face new 
pressures next Congress to address Global Warming  This is truly a 
remarkable speech

FORD PREDICTS END OF CAR POLLUTION
The Independent UK
 October 

Internet
http  wwwindependentcouk news UK Environment  fordshtml

The year reign of the polluting internal combustion engine is coming to
an end Bill Ford chairman of the Ford Motor Company said yesterday It
will soon be replaced in motor vehicles by the hydrogen fuel cell which
emits no pollution whatsoever and so can reduce the buildup of greenhouse
gases causing climate change Mr Ford greatgrandson of the companys
founder Henry Ford told the Greenpeace Business Conference in London

In a remarkable speech from a motor manufacturer in which he proclaimed his
own environmental credentials Mr Ford  accepted that the automobile had
had a serious negative impact on the environment and that his industry had
wrongly played down the threat from global warming  And the head of the
worlds second biggest car company raised eyebrows even further when he said
that he could foresee the day when people would not want to own cars but
merely have access to mobility

Detroitborn Mr Ford who has been chairman since the start of last year
proclaimed that climate change was the most challenging issue facing the
world and that anyone who disagreed was in denial Ford itself had moved on
from that position he said But he felt the Kyoto protocol the  pact in
which the industrialised nations agreed to try to limit their emission of
greenhouse gases would not provide deep enough cuts to halt global warming
Only the marketplace making new technology widely available could tackle
the problem

A fuel cell creates energy by an electrochemical process similar to that in a
battery it lets hydrogen and oxygen react together to produce electricity
and water vapour It does not run down or need recharging working as long as
the hydrogen fuel is available but most importantly it does not produce any
CO the basic byproduct of any carbonbased fuel such as oil gas or coal
Every major car company in the world is throwing huge sums into developing
the technology Ford is spending bn m between now and  while
DaimlerChrysler regarded as the leader in the field has spent m All
the main manufacturers have prototype fuelcell cars running and there is a
race to bring them to market Honda and Toyota expect to do so in  while
Ford and DaimlerChrysler are aiming at 

I believe fuel cells will finally end the year reign of the internal
combustion engine Mr Ford said adding that the technology was the holy
grail of the motor industry Prophesying the demise of car ownership he
said  The day will come when the whole notion of car ownership is
antiquated he said Mr Ford was reflecting advanced motor industry
thinking which suggests many people might not want to pay for a car of their
own if they could be guaranteed mobility on demand from a local hire network

Interesting timing for your question  My take after discussions with Terry

development but that Palmisano was utilizing her for greenhouse gas related 
issues since not much had occurred on the other front yet  Burt Mike and I 
learned last week that she actually reports to Palmisanohe is the one who 
took her from consultant to employee status  I spoke with John on Friday and 
told him that I wasnt going to poach her now that I knew where she fit in 
the scheme of things  

This actually solves a dilemma for me anyway  As you know I need a more 
senior environmental person with good high level relationships with NGOs and 
I didnt want her to feel slighted when I found someone  Moreover she has 
just advised us that she and her husband are moving to San Francisco and 
wants to telecommute  This should work fine for John but I feel it is 
important for my person to be in DC or NY

		 Subject Fuel Cells Get Financial Boost from US Government

http  wwwconsultrcicom

 

A new SCIENTECH PowerHitter interview with E Linn Draper Chairman 
President 
and CEO of American Electric Power is now available  Find out more at
http  wwwconsultrcicom



SCIENTECH IssueAlert October  
Fuel Cells Get Financial Boost from US Government
By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis


The Department of Energy will have more than  million for fuel cell 
related programs in the new fiscal year  million above the presidents 
request The money is contained in the Interior Appropriation bill that 
President Clinton signed last week The House and Senate jointly agreed 
upon  million for stationary fuel cells  million more than 
requested 
and approved the full request of  million for transportation fuel 
cell research and  million for buildings

ANALYSIS This government funding which is surprisingly higher than 
expected 
should give a muchneeded boost to the slowmoving development of fuel 
cells Although generally considered the favorite of low   zero emission 
energy solutions fuel cells are still about two to three years away from 
being commercially viable in retail markets Phosphoric acid fuel cells 
developed by ONSI a division of United Technologies are presently available 
in a limited capacity The technology has been in existence ever since 
batteries were discovered  years ago but the high cost of producing 
them has precluded suppliers from making fuel cells readily available to 
the general public Automotive giants like DaimlerChrysler and Ford Motor 
Co have continued to explore the use of fuel cells in automobiles and 
Texaco Inc agreed in May to invest  million in Energy Conversion 
Devices a yearold fuel cell and alternative energy development firm 
Yet this financial support for the DOEs exploration of fuel cells signals 
significant support from the federal government In addition warnings 
about the high cost of oil and natural gas and the reports of low supplies 
of energy in states across the country continue to scare energy endusers 
and may be spurring a renewed interest in distributed generation options

Heres how fuel cells work They use an electrochemical reaction as opposed 
to traditional combustion to generate electricity In other words fuel 
cells allow hydrogenrich fuels to react chemically with air without 
burning 
producing as a byproduct DC electricity water and heat In addition fuel 
cells dramatically lower the level of pollutants that are emitted into 
the environment Test models of fuel cells presently convert methanol 
gasoline and natural gas to produce hydrogen fuel Its easiest to think 
of a fuel cell as a battery but one that does not run down or need 
recharging 
although it will need replacing about every five years A fuel cell will 
produce energy in the form of DC electricity and heat as long as fuel is 
supplied As an added advantage fuel cells can be controlled remotely 
by computer and run rather quietly This is perhaps the primary incentive 
for endusers that would be interested in fuel cell technology Especially 
for facilities like hospitals the attributes of low noise and nearzero 
pollution are very appealing

Currently fuel cells are being tested and developed by laboratories and 
think tanks around the world hoping to make this lowpolluting form of 
generation available for widespread use by  or  Under the DOE 
grant money provided for stationary fuel cells will fund research and 
development to reduce costs and improve performance It is hoped that this 
will lead to marketready fuel cell power systems within three years In 
addition the funding allocates  million to transportation fuel cell 
research such as integrating fuel cell stacks with fuel processors and 
balanceofplant technologies for testing This program also will examine 
the technology barriers to fuelflexible systems for automobile applications 
The  million reserved for buildings will go toward developing a prototype 
fuel processor completing the design competition for a kW cogenerator 
for buildings and other research and development

Deregulation has cast light on alternative forms of power supply As 
customers 
possibly decide to use onsite generation as opposed to power delivered 
across a transmission grid this dramatically alters the traditional business 
of most energy companies Large commercial and industrial customers that 
suddenly opt for fuel cell solutions to their energy needs would have 
dramatic 
financial impact on their incumbent energy provider As a result many 
electric utilities and energy providers are investing in fuel cells as 
a hedge against a possible shrinkage within their own supply businesses 
Southern Company is a good example Just this month Southern joined Alabama 
Municipal Electric Authority MercedesBenz US International Inc and 
FuelCell Energy in a partnership to drive a growing interest in fuel cell 
technology Specifically Southern is providing funding for a fuel cell 
plant to be located in the service territory of Alabama Power a Southern 
subsidiary The plant will convert pipeline natural gas into electricity 
at a reported efficiency of about  percent compared with  percent 
for conventional generation which will feed the power distribution system 
of MercedesBenz

Another example is Enron which just two weeks ago entered into an alliance 
with FuelCell Energy Inc to develop and market FuelCell Energys Direct 
FuelCell products focusing on state renewable and energy conservation 
programs As part of the partnership Enron is investing about  million 
in the common stock of FuelCell Energy In its announcement of the 
partnership 
Enron stated that the transaction enables us to reach the developing markets 
for clean energy and renewable energy which may be served through 
distributed 
generation products such as fuel cells

These are just two examples of many energy companies that are devoting 
money to fuel cells and other forms of distributed generation Some state 
regulatory commissions have debated whether or not to allow utilities to 
own their own distributed generation equipment technologies As a result 
we are seeing a trend of utilities investing in companies that are already 
developing distributed generation solutions instead of doing it themselves

The investment appears to be a smart one According to Stephens Inc 
an investment banking firm common industry projections put the potential 
for the automotive fuel cell market at  billion annually by  and 
as high as  billion cumulative for the stationary power markets within 
 years The increase is due in large part to the growth of Internetbased 
industry and the need for missioncritical systems at dotcom operations 
Microturbinessmall generators that can produce enough power for a small 
businesshave beaten fuel cells to market and are currently manufactured 
by the likes of Capstone Caterpillar and Solar Turbines Microturbines 
reportedly could be potentially superior to fuel cells with regard to low 
emissions Many energy companies and power marketers such as Williams 
Alliant Energy and American Energy Savings have made announcements just 
within the last month that they will market microturbines to customers 
Yet the distributed generation market should become much tighter once 
fuel cells become commercially available something that this hefty new 
grant from the US government should push forward

years on telecom acquisitions Find out more about SCIENTECHS

I wanted to update you on my conversation this morning with Mark Lindsay 
regarding next weeks budget meeting

The format will be similar to last years  Well be receiving from Marks 
group a consolidated spreadsheet of all of our budgets grouping them by 
functionality and illustrating  plan  estimate and  plan and 
the variances between  We will be covering the EPSC and Aviation budgets 
during the same meeting  Billie and I will get together on Friday to compare 
what the two of us have so far and then we have a meeting set up for Monday 
morning with you Bill Billie and me to go over everything in advance of 
Tuesdays meeting

Points that Mark made no surprises here
  Jeff has mentioned that he wants to see reductions in all corporate cost 
centers since our international activities look like theyre going away  We 
have made significant reductions year to year on our international govt 
affairs and PR budgets and I think we can justify that the other cost 
centers are primarily focused on domestic activities while the individual 
business units budget much of those activities themselves
  Even though were allocating more overall to the business units this year 
Jeff will be interested in the gross budget numbers before any allocations
  We need to be able to explain any significant budget changes year to year
   Mark particularly emphasized the increase in the PR budget most of which 
is retained at Corp anyway
   We need to be able to explain anything that weve inherited from the 
business units that is now staying at Corp  This  applies to the headcount 
that weve picked up from ENA and from Intl Dennis group  

Lindsay mentioned that theres a possibility that Causey may in advance of 
our Tuesday meeting meet by himself with Skilling to get a general idea of 
where Jeff stands on the corporate budgets as theyve been submitted so far 
and then come back to us with instructions on any changes that need to be 
made  If this is the case we may have to make cuts before we get to present 
our case

Im working on our presentation based on that conversation and will forward

Businesses feel strains of political shakedown 
By KAREN MASTERSON 
Copyright  Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau 
WASHINGTON  Business executives are being tapped for record amounts of 
money to support political campaigns and are tired of what one calls the 
shakedown by candidates and their parties according to two studies 
released Wednesday 
Nearly  million has been raised in socalled soft money  unlimited 
contributions from corporations unions and wealthy individuals to political 
action committees 
That figure is five times the amount of soft money raised in the presidential 
election year of  according to the Federal Election Commission 
A poll of businesses released Wednesday shows that the pressure put on 
corporate executives to make large contributions is creating a backlash that 
could lead to reform next year in Congress 
The study reveals that  percent of corporate heads feel pressure to give 
half said they fear repercussions if they turn down requests for money and 
consequently  percent support a ban on soft money 
Overall contributions  for spending on both campaigns and issue ads  have 
surpassed those made during the  campaigns for president the House and 
the Senate by  million This election cycles total now at  billion 
reflects contributions made in the  months leading up to June  
Those against the influence of money on politics worry most that much more is 
to come Their estimates put total campaign contributions up to  billion  
more than the total budget of many small countries  once the remaining 
months of this year are accounted for 
Even before this election season began we knew that the  election was 
going to be one for the record books said Larry Makinson executive 
director of Center for Responsive Politics a nonprofit group that watches 
campaign contributions and their influence on policy 
A lot is at stake this year including the White House and control of the 
House where Republicans hold a narrow majority Democrats also hope to 
recover at least a few seats in the Senate 
The centers analysis of FEC records shows that the computer industry leaped 
from a rank of  in campaign giving in  to eighth place this year 
providing  million in nearly equal amounts to Democrats and Republicans 
By splitting their money the industry has gotten just about everything its 
asked for from Congress Makinson said Among those requests are a 
moratorium on an Internet sales tax and an increase in immigration visas for 
hightech job applicants 
Efforts to ban soft money have been made on Capitol Hill but have gone 
nowhere And the two presidential candidates who made a softmoney ban 
central to their campaigns  Sen John McCain RAriz and former Sen Bill 
Bradley DNJ  lost their primary election bids 
Advocates of a total ban hope the business survey means executives are ready 
to act against the status quo 
I remember  and  contributions in soft money said Harry 
Freeman a former executive vice president of American Express Co a 
position he held until  Now he said executives are asked for  
and  
And some executives see the practice as anticompetitive Freeman said 
because significant resources are going into political campaigns instead of 
being reinvested in a companys ability to compete in the marketplace 
Some are fascinated by politicians and think its a big ideological thing to 
contribute But the poll shows most people see it as a shakedown said 
Freeman who is currently a trustee of the Committee for Economic 
Development a probusiness public policy institute that favors campaign 
finance overhaul and is supported by officials at Hasbro Genesco PPL Inc 
and other companies 
The center commissioned the business survey which included a random sample 
of  corporate executives 
Soft money allows politicians and political committees to ask for huge sums 
of money way beyond the limits placed on socalled hard money which is 
capped and controlled by the Federal Election Commission 
Because of soft money the message to donors is forget the limits Makinson 
said Wednesday at a Center for Responsive Politics news conference 
He said the ballooning of campaign contributions is backed by a recent 
federal court order that found the FEC limits on issuead spending were 
applicable if the advertisement blatantly promoted one candidate and included 
the term vote for   
But Makinson said only  percent of television ads fall into that narrowly 
defined category This is a messy area that Congress sooner or later will 
have to deal with he said 
Both hard and soft money raised for the presidential campaign including 
individual and party contributions is up  percent from  million in 
 to  million in  Congressional campaign contributions have 
increased  percent in the same time period from  million to  
million And Senate campaigns have gone up  percent from  million to 
 million mainly because of hugely expensive races in New York and New 
Jersey 
Texans alone gave more than  million in campaign contributions with  
percent going to Republicans Texas ranks fourth in campaign contributions 
behind California New York and the District of Columbia according to the 
centers analysis 
Among those to make the centers list of top  individual donors is 
Houstonian Kenneth Lay who runs Enron and is a longtime supporter and family 
friend of former President George Bush He gave more than  almost 
exclusively to Republicans 
Sam Wyly another Texan gave Republicans more than  He is an 
investor who ran a special interest group that criticized McCain during the 
primaries 
Two Texas congressmen raised among the largest pools of money for use in 
boosting other candidates campaigns House Majority Whip Tom DeLay RSugar 
Land distributed  House Majority Leader Dick ArmeyRIrving gave 
away  according to the Center for Responsive Politics

Renaming the Dome Rely on it 
By ERIC BERGER 
Copyright  Houston Chronicle 
Reliant Energy is expected to pay about  million to splash its name 
across the new football stadium and Astrodome complex by far the most ever 
for a sports facilitys name 
Although negotiators said Wednesday that the naming rights agreement was not 
yet signed they said talks were feverish and that a formal announcement is 
likely next week 
Under the proposed agreement outlined by sources close to the talks Reliant 
would pay about  million a year to name the  million football stadium 
being built for the Houston Texans The energy company would pay an 
additional  to secure naming rights for the entire Astrodome complex 
including the Dome the AstroArena and a new exposition center 
The deal expected to include a stadium suite for Reliant extensive 
advertising throughout the facility and rides on the team plane for company 
executives would run for  years 
Reliants bid comes the same year that Enron Field opened in downtown Houston 
bearing the name of a chief local competitor Enron Corp 
Both energy utilities have eyed naming rights as valuable promotional tools 
to boost their profiles as electricity deregulation looms in Texas and around 
the country 
The Reliant deal also comes on the heels of an  percent rate increase by 
the companys HLP unit in August and a proposed  percent increase by 
December to offset rising fuel costs 
If signed the agreement would be the most lucrative naming rights deal ever 
both in total dollars and number of years 
About a year ago FedEx agreed to pay  million over  years to name the 
Washington Redskins football stadium the largest deal to date in total 
dollars And in February  Royal Philips Electronics agreed to pay about 
 million a year for  years to name the home of the Atlanta Hawks 
basketball team and Thrashers hockey team  the largest annual sum to date 
Officials with the Houston Texans owned by Bob McNair steadfastly denied a 
deal had been signed 
A deal is not in place We continue to have discussions said Jamey Rootes 
senior vice president of marketing for the Texans 
However another team source  speaking on condition of anonymity  
confirmed that the  million annual figure was accurate and that Reliant 
had beat out Dynegy whose chairman Chuck Watson owns a minority share of 
the football team 
The Houston stadium is particularly valuable because of its rodeo ties and 
the likelihood it will host multiple Super Bowls said Jeff Knapple 
president and chief executive officer of Envision a Los Angelesbased 
consulting company Houston is all but guaranteed to host the  Super 
Bowl 
The Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo draws  million visitors a year and the 
name of a stadium hosting a Super Bowl is heard by an estimated  billion 
people around the world on Super Bowl Sunday 
As part of the stadium financing deal the Texans will receive  percent of 
the money paid for the stadiums naming rights with the facilitys other 
main tenant the rodeo receiving  percent 
Harris County which owns the Astrodome complex will receive the remaining  
percent of the stadium naming rights fee and all of the  yearly 
payment for the rights to the rest of the complex If Reliant is chosen the 
county also would receive  a year for giving the energy company the 
exclusive right to provide power 
The football stadium is scheduled to open in August  at which time the 
Astrodome would have no tenants Although Harris County Judge Robert Eckels 
has ruled out tearing down the Dome the county has not decided what to do 
with the building 
Although the naming rights deal encompasses the Astrodome and AstroArena the 
rights to those buildings could be resold if they are refurbished for 
different purposes two county sources said 
If the county were to build a new arena at the complex Reliant would be 
given the first option to bid on the name 
It was only three years ago that Compaq Computer Corp scored what now 
appears a bargain spending  million to rename The Summit for eight 
years 
Since then the value of naming rights has skyrocketed as dotcoms technology 
companies insurance vendors and utilities have scrambled to achieve name 
recognition in an increasingly cluttered media world 
Only a couple of years after Compaqs deal Enron paid  million over  
years to name the downtown ballpark 
During negotiations with the Houston Rockets to build a downtown arena 
earlier this year the city also sought to cash in on the escalating value of 
naming rights If voters approved the agreement Nov  the city would 
receive  percent of the arenas naming rights to be capped at  a 
year 


	

Enron Considering India Oil Gas Assets Sale

  
Dow Jones Energy Service
Copyright c  Dow Jones  Company Inc

SINGAPORE Dow Jones Enron India a unit of USbased Enron Corp ENE 
is considering selling its oil and gas assets in the country a spokesman for 
the company said Thursday 
Enron India operates three offshore oil and gas fields in a joint venture 
with Oil  Natural Gas Co PONG and Reliance Petroleum Ltd RRPT The 
Tapti Panna and Mukta fields are located off the coast of Gujerat and 
Maharastra
It holds a  stake in each field while ONGC and Reliance hold  and  
stakes respectively 
Enron India is considering the sale of these oil and gas fields said the 
spokesman He declined to say how soon the company would arrive at a 
decision 
He stressed that there would be no disruptions in the operations while the 
company was mulling the sale 
He added that there would also be no disruptions in the runup to any 
withdrawal should the company opt to sell their stakes in the fields 
A spokesman for JV partner ONGC said the company would be keen to buy Enrons 
stake if it went up for sale Our company will take a look at it Theres no 
reason why ONGC shouldnt be keen he said 

Analysts said Enron may be seeking to divest its oil and gas assets to focus 
instead on new economy sectors such as telecommunications This could be a 
reshuffle as to where they focus their exposure Theres a big push in the 
telecom space said a Hong Kongbased oil and gas analyst with an 
international merchant bank 
The analyst said Enrons possible divestment of its oil and gas assets wasnt 
overly negative for Indias foreign investment program 
Oil companies are always pruning and tweaking their portfolios even in core 
areas This isnt the beginning of the end of Enrons participation in 
India he said 
Sanjeev Prasad an oil and gas research analyst with Bombaybased Kotak 
Securities said Enron Indias proposal to shed its oil and gas operation was 
indicative of a broader plan by parent company Enron Corp to slim down its 
global operations 
Globally they have been doing it divesting itself of global assets and I 
am not too surprised they have done it here Prasad said 
If Enron India did proceed with its oil and gas sale Prasad didnt expect it 
to have any major repercussions in the energy sector as a whole It Enron 
doesnt have much exposure in oil and gas in India he said 
He added that Reliance Petroleum could emerge as a likely buyer of Enrons 
stake Theyre very likely candidates he said The Hong Kongbased analyst 
also said Reliance Petroleum could emerge as a prospective buyer if Enron 
sold its oil and gas stake 
Reliance Petroleum officials were unavailable for comment when contacted by 
Dow Jones Newswires 
Current production in Enron Indias three west coast offshore fields is 
approximately  million cubic feet a day of gas and  barrels a day of 
oil 
Enrons oil gas and power holdings in India are estimated to be worth around 
US billion 
The companys Dabhol power project due to be completed in the fourth quarter 
of  will generate  megawatts of power to become the worlds largest 
independent natural gasfired power plant 
Enron closed the US billion financing of the second phase of the Dabhol 
project in May  The financing includes a liquefied natural gas terminal 
and regasification plant allowing India to import natural gas for the first 
time 
Enron contracts to purchase  million tons of LNG from Oman and Abu Dhabi 
to supply Dabhol when the second phase is completed end

Former Minn Legislator Eyes Huge Wind Project In Plains
By Jon Kamp
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

  
Dow Jones Energy Service
Copyright c  Dow Jones  Company Inc

CHICAGO Dow Jones Minnesota farmer Jim Nichols has a healthy soybean and 
corn crop this year 
But it never hurts to have a little business on the side or big ideas So 
Nichols a former Minnesota legislator is trying to set up a megawatt 
 billion wind power project in South Dakota Iowa and Minnesota
This is a giant step forward Nichols said This one project more than 
doubles all the wind power in the country now 
Few US companies truly sell wind power competitively But with natural gas 
prices soaring and environmental laws becoming tougher the renewable energy 
source is poised to become a real option for developers Nichols said You 
just have to build on the right scale 
Nichols project expected to be completed in  is truly enormous It 
would require  wind turbines priced at about  million each The 
turbines would stretch for  miles across three states and generate close 
to half the power of the Grand Coulee Dam 
Nichols is planning to develop the wind farms with Clipper LLC a recently 
formed Santa Barbara Califbased wind development firm 
Nichols and Ken Hach Clippers new project developer and a former employee 
of Enron Corps ENE wind development unit hope to support the project by 
inking longterm power contracts with Midwestern utilities like Chicagos 
Commonwealth Edison Co 
The wind project isnt Nichols first foray into the wind business In  
he helped broker a deal that requires Minneapolisbased Xcel Energy Inc 
XEL to buy  megawatts of wind power by  in exchange for permission 
to build new storage space for spent nuclear fuel 
This new project however is considerably more complex and faces plenty of 
potential stumbling blocks First is the massive price tag 
The problem with this concept is youre asking big bucks said Linda Byus 
a utilities analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Bensen in Chicago 
Land will have to be acquired to site the turbines And new transmission 
lines will have to be strung something few utilities have been able to 
accomplish on any scale in recent years 
In addition  brace yourselves environmentalists  the project isnt 
entirely green 
Since wind turbines can only be expected to turn about a third of the time 
Nichols and Hach will have to line up a backup source of power to ensure that 
the longterm supply contracts they sign with utilities dont go unfulfilled 
Although the developers could look to existing plants in the region the 
backup theyre eying is new coal According to Nichols some coal companies 
in Wyoming are ready and willing to build six megawatt plants to support 
the wind power contracts Northern Plains A Welcome Site 

On the plus side natural gas prices have soared to record highs and many 
companies are looking for ways to soften their dependence on the fuel and its 
volatile wholesale markets said John Dunlop regional manager for the 
American Wind Energy Association 
Theres a huge load that people are salivating to satisfy he said 
The northern Plains  flat sparsely populated and home to steady winds  is 
the place to build The industry said Bob Gates senior vice president of 
Enron Wind calls the region the Saudi Arabia of wind 
South Dakota at least is actively soliciting developers of wind power 
South Dakota Public Utilities Commission Chairman Jim Burg who is hosting a 
meeting on the states windpower prospects Wednesday and Thursday said many 
communities are vying for the chance to host windpower projects 
Fees provide some incentive  landowners may be offered  of the sale price 
of power generated on their land  as does the prospect of adding hundreds of 
new jobs 
I have a hard time not being a major proponent Burg said We havent had 
that kind of economic impact for a long time 
Floridas FPL Group FPL the largest windpower operator in the US is 
already looking at acquiring land in South Dakota Burg said 
We definitely see South Dakota as a place to be in the future said FPL 
spokeswoman Cathy Scott 
Enron is also interested in the northern Plains 
Weve done some development work in the area Gates said And weve been 
talking with Clipper and other developers on a variety of projects in the 
area 
Gates citing confidentiality agreements declined to comment on whether the 
company is directly involved in Nichols projects But he did say Enron has 
worked with Nichols before and has the capability to develop every aspect of 
a wind generating project 
Hach while acknowledging the difficulties of raising financing for wind 
projects said funds could probably be found 
The level of interest on Wall Street is probably not as high as it should 
be he said But If the economics work the financing will come By Jon 
Kamp Dow Jones Newswires

		 Subject Economics Study on Proposed Houston SIPPreliminary Results

You might mark your calendar for a lunch  at the Hyatt downtown on 
Wednesday December  where Barton Smith of UH and George Tolley of the U of 
Chicago will present the findings of their economic study  The Houston Forum 
event will be part of the Kenneth L Lay Lecture Series in Global Economics 
at the University of Houston  I will have a table for Enron

The authors presented their preliminary results to us this week and the 
total benefits of the planned ozone reduction all SIP measures as currently 
proposed are below  million we are indoors most of the time that bad 
air days are occurring since it is typically very hot and the costs are 
around  billion out to    Lots of caveats to this conclusion including 
the assumption of todays best technology but no more  The high costs 
include a last mile problem that the proposal of the Partnerships Business 
Coalition for Clean Air BCCA avoids such as no noontomidnight 
construction a  average point source reduction to allow for trading and 
future permits instead of a  reduction etc

The effect on Houston is to reduce our forecast economic growth but not 
eliminate it  Real wages are forecast to fall by some  or more under the 
current SIP versus without it  Total job loss will be over about a 
 and a half years of growth out to    This shock will be around 
onehalf of what Houston went through after the oil price crash in  
according to Dr Smith  One might say that slower growth and spreading the 
pollution around some of our refinery petrochemical growth going elsewhere 
is not the end of the world however if a more costeffective SIP is chosen

It will be several weeks before the results are final and the election 
over at which time an executive summary will be released  The Mayors 
office and TNRCC will be briefed first  The luncheon will be the formal 
unveiling of the study with explanation but I expect press coverage of the 
study next month

As head of the economics working group I have tried to ensure that a 
topnotch analysis was done without an industry bias  The results are 
considered conservative by the authors all things considered and in line with 
the peerreviewed literature on costs and benefits  The study is not 
intended to be a whining study but to give us realistic expectations and to 
naturally bring into review some last mile problems where certain SIP 
measures are the least cost effective

These preliminary results are confidential given the political cycle we are 
in and should not be shared externally

but none of them ended up owing corporate income taxes over that period 
according to a study released yesterday Indeed as a group the companies 
received  million in credits or refunds the report found 
The study of  large publicly traded companies showed that  owed no tax 
or received credits against past or future tax obligations in  up from 
 in  and  in  The study also found that  of the  companies 
paid taxes at less than half the official  percent corporate rate during 
the threeyear period 
The study was conducted by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy a 
Washington research organization associated with Citizens for Tax Justice a 
nonprofit group supported in part by labor unions The group argues that the 
tax system favors the rich and politically connected 
Corporate profits overall soared  percent during the threeyear period 
but corporate tax revenues grew just  percent a disjunction that has 
drawn intense interest from the Treasury Department and some members of 
Congress who are concerned about the growing market for tax shelters and 
their abuse 
In recent years Congress has watered down the  overhaul of the tax laws 
which lowered rates and eliminated most tax shelters and was supposed to 
simplify reporting The recent changes have opened fresh opportunities for 
corporations to cut their taxes the study found 
Corporate taxes are not rising along with profits because companies have 
found all sorts of ways to get around the reforms in the  tax act said 
Robert S McIntyre the director of Citizens for Tax Justice Companies 
also have gotten a lot of help from Congress especially in gutting the 
minimum tax rules 
Mr McIntyre said that he and T D Coo Nguyen the coauthor spent more 
than two years examining financial statements the companies sent to 
shareholders 
All but  of the companies studied are on the Fortune  list and the 
others are in the Fortune  He said companies were excluded if they lost 
money or their tax disclosures were crafted so that you could not figure 
them out 
At least two companies objected to the studys methodology 
Keith Price a spokesman for Goodyear said the study did not appear to 
consider an accounting rule affecting its sale of a pipeline subsidiary in 
 It made no objection to the  and  figures 
Michael N Ambler Texacos chief tax counsel said that his company had tax 
disputes with the Internal Revenue Service that were unresolved after more 
than a decade If those disputes are settled with a refund he said that can 
easily distort the figures for any one year He said that even the threeyear 
study period was too short to give an accurate picture 
Timothy McCormally of the Tax Executives Institute which represents 
officials at large companies told Bloomberg News that the companies named in 
the report did nothing wrong There is nothing in the report that suggests 
that any of this results from any illegal or improper activity he said 
The study by the Washington institute showed that the corporate tax burden 
was falling in many cases because of the growing use of stock options which 
are an expense for tax purposes but do not count against profits reported to 
shareholders 
Recent annual reports filed by Microsoft and Cisco Systems indicate that they 
paid no federal income taxes in  because stock options exercised by 
employees wiped out profits for tax purposes 
The study found that General Electric IBM Pfizer Intel and 
BristolMyers Squibb also sharply reduced their tax rates because of stock 
options without having to show reduced earnings to shareholders 
The most significant factor in the easing corporate tax burden Mr McIntyre 
said can be traced to actions in Congress which relaxed the corporate 
minimum tax in  when the Democrats were in control of both the House and 
Senate and again in  after the Republicans had taken over Congress 
made it easier for corporations to spread tax breaks and profits over many 
years including reaching back to past years to get tax breaks that could not 
be used at the time 
In at least one of the three years studied  of the  large companies 
studied paid no federal income tax Those  companies reported  billion 
in profits to shareholders in the years they paid no taxes If they had been 
obligated to pay the full  percent corporate rate the tax bill would have 
been  billion but the companies received  billion in refunds 
In total dollars General Electric was the biggest beneficiary of tax breaks 
the study said saving  billion in three years The company paid  
billion in income taxes on  billion in profits for a tax rate of  
percent 
The highest tax rate for the three years was paid by WinnDixie Stores which 
paid an average of  percent of its  through  profits in federal 
income taxes It was one of two companies that paid more than the  percent 
statutory rate because of multiyear tax rules The other was Paccar

Arena boosters tout  benefits 
Some question property sales tax numbers new development 
By ERIC BERGER 
Copyright  Houston Chronicle 
Enron Field sparked the redevelopment of downtowns east side boosters say 
and an arena would crown the revitalization of the longneglected area 
A strongly proarena business organization Central Houston Inc released a 
flurry of positive economic numbers to back its contention that Enron Field 
is a boon to downtown as well as to city county and school tax coffers and 
that the arena would be as well 
Theres no better way to measure the impact of sports facilities on downtown 
than to look at the one we already have said the organizations president 
Bob Eury as he crooked a finger toward the ballpark 
Eury and other boosters outlined three economic benefits to Houston they say 
are related to sports facilities increased property tax revenues a wealth 
of new development in the area and a boost in sales tax collected 
But economic analysts questioned some of their conclusions 
When Enron Field was built nine blocks were taken off the tax rolls at a 
cost of about  in lost property taxes 
Eury said though that it was not a bad trade 
He noted that properties around the ballpark have leaped in value since the 
Enron Field project began in the mids In turn the annual property tax 
collected on land and buildings within four blocks of the ballpark is  
million greater now than in  
But Harris County Tax AssessorCollector Paul Bettencourt said those figures 
are due in part to the boom in land values across downtown including the 
central business district since  
Bettencourt said he hoped to have an analysis finished today to determine 
whether land values around Enron Field had increased at a greater rate than 
land in the rest of downtown 
The boosters also highlighted more than  million worth of private 
developments planned  but not yet completed  near the ballpark including 
the  million story Ballpark Place Tower across Crawford Street from 
Enron Field 
Without a doubt if Enron Field was not there Ballpark Place would not be 
there said John Holland an executive vice president for the Trammel Crow 
Co which expects to break ground on the project in early  
Because the arena would be built in an urban core even academics who are 
skeptical about the economic benefits of sports stadiums agreed that spinoff 
development is likely nearby 
But independent economists who have studied such issues including Brad 
Humphreys an assistant professor at the University of MarylandBaltimore 
County say development near a stadium usually has a negative impact on 
development and businesses in other parts of a city 
The focus must be on the entire market Humphreys said not just in the 
vicinity of a sports facility 
Public subsidization of stadiums and arenas isnt necessarily a bad thing 
he said But when they sell them as economic engines its just absolutely 
wrong The research doesnt show that 
A recent study Humphreys coauthored which appeared in the fall  issue 
of the Journal of Policy Analysis and Management found that the presence of 
professional sports teams in a market on average actually reduced the 
percapita income in those markets compared with similar markets without 
such teams 
Given Houstons strong economy Eury said he does not believe downtown 
development will detract from other areas of the city as Humphreys studies 
have shown in other markets 
A third major economic benefit offered Thursday was that a new arena with 
the Houston Rockets and Houston Comets as tenants would generate  million 
a year in sales tax revenues 
About  million of that would go into local coffers with the remainder 
going to the state according to the study performed for Eurys group by CSL 
International a consulting firm 
Yet even in the absence of a new arena and both teams many economists say a 
large portion of those expenditures would be spent in the area anyway That 
is known as a substitution effect 
Instead of a family going to a game it might go to the movies or local zoo 
And corporations are likely to sponsor other local events out of their 
advertising budgets the economists say 
The CSL study did not account for this substitution effect in calculating the 
sales tax impact said Bill Rhoda the firms director

US Rep Drafts Bill To Impose Windfall Tax On Pwr Companies
By JASON LEOPOLD

  
Dow Jones Energy Service
Copyright c  Dow Jones  Company Inc

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Californias summer of soaring wholesale 
electricity prices helped boost the stock price of many energy companies in 
the third quarter
But if US Rep Bob Filner DCalif gets his way those companies will be 
forced to pay back hundreds of millions of dollars in profit to utilities 
customers and the government 
Filner introduced a bill in the House of Representatives last week that would 
impose a windfall profit tax on wholesale power sold throughout the western 
US 
The bill which was referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means may be 
discussed in December or January according to Filner and if he gets enough 
support by the mostly Republican caucus companies like Enron Corp ENE 
Duke Energy North America DUK Southern Co SO Reliant Energy REI and 
Dynegy DYN would only be allowed to show a certain amount of profit and 
anything over that amount would be taxed  
Filner said the amount of profit hasnt been determined but his bill calls 
for a baseline that would be a just and reasonable amount of profit 
The congressmans San Diego constituents were paying marketbased electricity 
rates in the summer which resulted in tripledigit utility bills He said 
generators are gouging California customers and need to be held responsible 
This is not just a problem of supply and demand Filner told Dow Jones 
Newswires This is stealing And we want our money back 
State and federal regulators are conducting separate investigations into 
Californias wholesale power crisis The findings expected to be complete in 
about two weeks are aimed at determining if generators or other key players 
manipulated the states wholesale energy market 
At least two major energy companies are being investigated by California 
Attorney General Bill Lockyer A high level source working on the probe with 
the Attorney General said thirdquarter earnings statements will play a major 
role in finding out if generators manipulated the market 
Their investigation isnt turning up much evidence but earnings statements 
are showing that profits are up significantly largely due to wholesale prices 
in California the source said 
At least one Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioner who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity said the wholesale electricity market in California 
will be in for a rude awakening when the agency completes its 
investigation 
There will be some serious structural changes to the market the 
commissioner said 
Representatives from energy companies told Dow Jones Newswires that higher 
profits werent the result of illegal activity or manipulating the market 
Energy Cos Say Summer Crisis Boosted Q Earnings 
On Wednesday Duke Energy which owns and operates power plants in 
California said in an earnings statement that thirdquarter profit rose  
due in part to high wholesale prices in California in the summer Enron and 
several other companies reported similar thirdquarter increases based on 
Californias summer of skyrocketing power prices 
The congressman doesnt want to limit the proposed windfall tax to 
California but where generators sell power in the western US 
But even Filner admits that forcing generators to refund part of their 
profits isnt getting the early support it needs to become law 
If the democrats were in charge Id have this bill voted on already Filner 
said 
Filner said if the bill is passed some of the money would be refunded to 
consumers and utilities the victims as he refers to them 
Meanwhile hes also working on getting the House to pass a separate bill to 
roll back electricity rates in the western US to prederegulation levels 
and hes trying to gather support for a wind power initiative 
Regardless of the outcome the congressman is dead set on making noise 
If nothing happens Im thinking about holding a press conference with the 
San Diego District Attorney he said Well press criminal charges against 
the energy companies By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires

Pepsico JP Morgan Enron and General Motors the report found 
The studys chief author Robert S McIntyre said companies lower their 
taxes through such breaks as depreciation writeoffs tax credits for 
research and development and deductions they take when employees exercise 
stock options 
We hope our findings will encourage lawmakers to reexamine this important 
area of taxation McIntyre said 
The report also found that the petroleum industry paid the lowest tax rate 
from  at  percent followed by electronics at  percent 
forest and paper products at  percent and transportation at  percent 
At the other end of the spectrum publishing and printing companies paid  
percent gas and electric utilities paid  percent and retail and 
wholesale trade companies paid  percent 
Anyone who worries about our economys longterm growth has to wonder why 
the tax code is being used to favor some industries and some kinds of 
investments over others rather than letting market forces decide McIntyre

US Rep Drafts Bill To Impose Windfall Tax On Pwr Companies
By JASON LEOPOLD

  
Dow Jones Energy Service
Copyright c  Dow Jones  Company Inc

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Californias summer of soaring wholesale 
electricity prices helped boost the stock price of many energy companies in 
the third quarter
But if US Rep Bob Filner DCalif gets his way those companies will be 
forced to pay back hundreds of millions of dollars in profit to utilities 
customers and the government 
Filner introduced a bill in the House of Representatives last week that would 
impose a windfall profit tax on wholesale power sold throughout the western 
US 
The bill which was referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means may be 
discussed in December or January according to Filner and if he gets enough 
support by the mostly Republican caucus companies like Enron Corp ENE 
Duke Energy North America DUK Southern Co SO Reliant Energy REI and 
Dynegy DYN would only be allowed to show a certain amount of profit and 
anything over that amount would be taxed  
Filner said the amount of profit hasnt been determined but his bill calls 
for a baseline that would be a just and reasonable amount of profit 
The congressmans San Diego constituents were paying marketbased electricity 
rates in the summer which resulted in tripledigit utility bills He said 
generators are gouging California customers and need to be held responsible 
This is not just a problem of supply and demand Filner told Dow Jones 
Newswires This is stealing And we want our money back 
State and federal regulators are conducting separate investigations into 
Californias wholesale power crisis The findings expected to be complete in 
about two weeks are aimed at determining if generators or other key players 
manipulated the states wholesale energy market 
At least two major energy companies are being investigated by California 
Attorney General Bill Lockyer A high level source working on the probe with 
the Attorney General said thirdquarter earnings statements will play a major 
role in finding out if generators manipulated the market 
Their investigation isnt turning up much evidence but earnings statements 
are showing that profits are up significantly largely due to wholesale prices 
in California the source said 
At least one Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioner who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity said the wholesale electricity market in California 
will be in for a rude awakening when the agency completes its 
investigation 
There will be some serious structural changes to the market the 
commissioner said 
Representatives from energy companies told Dow Jones Newswires that higher 
profits werent the result of illegal activity or manipulating the market 
Energy Cos Say Summer Crisis Boosted Q Earnings 
On Wednesday Duke Energy which owns and operates power plants in 
California said in an earnings statement that thirdquarter profit rose  
due in part to high wholesale prices in California in the summer Enron and 
several other companies reported similar thirdquarter increases based on 
Californias summer of skyrocketing power prices 
The congressman doesnt want to limit the proposed windfall tax to 
California but where generators sell power in the western US 
But even Filner admits that forcing generators to refund part of their 
profits isnt getting the early support it needs to become law 
If the democrats were in charge Id have this bill voted on already Filner 
said 
Filner said if the bill is passed some of the money would be refunded to 
consumers and utilities the victims as he refers to them 
Meanwhile hes also working on getting the House to pass a separate bill to 
roll back electricity rates in the western US to prederegulation levels 
and hes trying to gather support for a wind power initiative 
Regardless of the outcome the congressman is dead set on making noise 
If nothing happens Im thinking about holding a press conference with the 
San Diego District Attorney he said Well press criminal charges against 
the energy companies By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires

Toronto Hydro Ontario Power Generation Launch EBT Express
By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis


Toronto Hydro Corporation and Ontario Power Generation announced that they 
have launched an electronic business transaction EBT hub that will 
provide centralized electronic data management and transaction services 
to local distribution companies LDCs and energy retailers in Ontario 
Called EBT Express the exchange will become operational when Ontarios 
new competitive electricity market opens next spring Excelergy eXACTv 
developed by energy software solutions company Excelergy Corporation will 
provide the technology infrastructure for EBT Express

ANALYSIS This is a significant development as EBT Express represents 
the first hub in Canada for retail energy transactions The site will serve 
as the central clearinghouse for immediate communication of customer data 
among hundreds of LDCs and energy retailers in Ontario and possibly 
throughout 
Canada  I spoke yesterday afternoon with George Caraghiaur Exelergys 
vice president Canada about EBT Express Caraghiaur believes that the 
site will provide the essential technology for opening Ontarios electricity 
market in an efficient manner That is no small undertaking as there are 
an expected  players that will need to communicate with each other in 
Ontario once competition begins

Deregulation is happening in Canada on a provincebyprovince basis much 
like it is happening statebystate in the US Thus far only Ontario 
and Alberta have set dates when electric customers will be able to select 
a new energy supplier Ontario is scheduled to become competitive next 
spring and presently is the only region in which EBT Express will be 
operational 
Alberta uses a pointtopoint transaction process which represents a very 
complex model Caraghiaur believes that the value of EBT Express will be 
clearly seen and there will be many opportunities for the hub in Alberta 
and elsewhere

The Ontario Energy Board OEB which is the equivalent of a state PUC 
mandated the use of electronic business transactions EBTs The EBTs work 
as follows Once a customer selects a new energy supplier the energy 
supplier 
and the local distribution company LDC must continue to share information 
about that customer This proprietary data shared strictly on a onetoone 
basis between the energy supplier and the LDC only will include billing 
usage and payment information Essentially an LDC will read the meter 
and send usage information to the energy supplier who will calculate its 
portion of a customers bill and in turn send this data back to the LDC 
which will submit the customer bill This represents a common way for billing 
in Ontario although there are other options including consolidated billing 
that originates from the energy supplier and split billing coming from 
both the LDC and energy supplier No customer information will be exchanged 
until competition officially begins in Ontario which now appears to be 
in the spring of  although the technology infrastructure supplied 
by Excelergy is already in place

In response to the OEBs mandate Toronto Hydro Corp and Ontario Power 
Generationthe largest players in electricity distribution and generation 
in Ontario became equity partners in the  million joint venture to 
create EBT Express All customer data will be contained within EBT Express 
which is supported by the eXACT technology Excelergy eXACT is a software 
solution that translates validates manages and delivers data exchanged 
among users The functionality of eXACT has been used in several US states 
including Pennsylvania and New Jersey In fact eXACT was introduced to 
gas and electricity retailers in the United States in  as a component 
of Excelergy ABPv a billing and customer information solution Allegheny 
Energy Supply a subsidiary of Allegheny Energy was one US utility that 
I know of that used the Excelergy technology 

Caraghiaur contends that EBT Express will play an important role in enhancing 
the competitive market in Ontario There are presently  licensed retailers 
in Ontario  pending retailers and  LDCs Caraghiaur told me You 
can imagine the cloud of communication pathways that would occur between 
all these players without a centralized hub such as EBT Express The number 
of LDCs seemed awfully high to me but Caraghiaur explained that in Ontario 
many LDCs serve only a small number of customers often  customers or 
less This should change as consolidation reduces the number of LDCs in 
Ontario but when compared to the United States Ontario still will have 
a comparatively high number of distribution companies 

Caraghiaur cited Pennsylvania as an example of a market that has tried 
to assimilate communication among many market participants Pennsylvania 
along with most other US states still uses electronic data interchange 
EDI as its standard wherein every LDC has a slightly different 
interpretation 
of data that is shared through the EDI This can often cause communication 
inconsistencies and retailers may have a difficult time in getting ready 
for deregulation EBT Express will be in the position to enforce standards 
says Caraghiaur The use of XML in particular will enhance communication 
between market participants

In fact XML extensible market language is the cornerstone of eXACT as 
it constructs a standardized language so that data can be exchanged but 
still understood by different applications Caraghiaur claims that Excelergy 
is on the forefront of XML technology which was expressly stipulated in 
the EBT standards developed by the Advisory Committee to the Ontario Energy 
Board XML is a common language used on the Internet that makes it easier 
and more costeffective for buyers and sellers to exchange data between 
applications and data sources that otherwise might have been incompatible 
In addition Excelergys eXACT software is objectoriented allowing for 
easy and rapid change from one program to another 

Clearinghouse exchanges are definitely a trend in the energy industry 
Whereas states that previously deregulated such as California and 
Pennsylvania 
did not use a centralized clearinghouse for customer information states 
and provinces now formulating their restructuring plans often mandate them 
For instance Excelergys competitor Logica has a market data clearinghouse 
built for the Midwest market Also the ERCOTISO has teamed with Andersen 
Consulting on a similar market data clearinghouse for the Texas unbundling 
scheduled for pilot in the summer of  and full market opening in January 


One concern that market participants may have is the sharing of customer 
data through EBT Express especially when it is backed by potential 
competitors 
in the Ontario market such as Toronto Hydro and Ontario Power Caraghiaur 
responded to this by saying that the OEB mandated the exchange of customer 
information through an EBT structure However market participants are 
not mandated to participate in EBT Express They could opt to still exchange 
information on a pointtopoint basis although Caraghiaur believes that 
EBT Express offers a much more efficient forum for the transfer of customer 
data In addition Caraghiaur reiterated that no proprietary or competitive 
information would be accessible between any parties other than the LDC 
and energy supplier involved in the exchange

Interestingly Toronto Hydro and Ontario Power may be competitors when 
the Ontario market opens next year Toronto Hydro Corp owns Toronto 
HydroElectric 
System Limited a regulated electricity distribution system and Toronto 
Hydro Energy Services a competitive energy service company Ontario Power 
Generation is an electricity generating company so Toronto Hydro and Ontario 
Power will be competing on the retail level to acquire energy supply 
contracts 
with lucrative customers And rumor has it that venerable retail giant 
Sears is also taking a look into becoming an energy retailer in Canada 
next year As Canada continues to deregulate and attract energy suppliers 
Excelergy anticipates that the EBT Express could serve a national market

		 Subject Friends of the Aquifer Inc Appeal of Denials of Petitions to DEP 
DCA and PSC

Chris Jensen Executive Director of the Florida Energy Pipeline Association 
has learned from some DEP agency contacts that the Alliance operating behind 
the front organization known as Friends of the Aquifer Inc has decided to 
drop their lawsuits appealing the denials of their petitions to more severely 
regulate pipelines in Florida  While this is good news for those of us 
fighting the war here in Florida the reason for this withdrawal of their 
appeals of failed efforts on three different petitions at the state level in 
Florida is because of their belief that their current activity at the Federal 
level holds greater promise of success and their desire to concentrate their 
resources in that effort

My thoughts on this is that the pipeline industry should get organized and 
execute a full court press defense which is proactive as we move into 
increased future efforts at the  Federal level by the Alliance through their 
other front organizations  These organizations have been created to burden 
pipeline competition to benefit the maritime interests

From my vantage point I am limited to mostly what I see in the press but  
these front organization are winning the battle in the national press that I 
have seen and heard  AOPL and INGAA do not come across in the press as being 
equipped or prepared to handle the shaping of the pipeline safety issues in 
the press that these Alliance front organizations have been doing

 Our Enron government affairs folks in Washington are knowledgeable 
experienced and capable They have been through this battle and other battles 
in the past  So this is not a criticism but just a friendly observation 
from a remote vantage point that if the entire pipeline industry does not 
develop a proactive plan to shape the issues in the national media during the 
next year we will find it very difficult or perhaps impossible to come out 
of Congress with legislation that is reasonable and workable from a safety 
regulation perspective  It has been my experience with the Alliance in the 
past that to any extent they are successful  they will then multiply their 
efforts and broaden their field of attack

The issue is not safety of pipelines but competition for the transportation 
of energy  We have an industry that can be very proud of its record of 
safety economic benefits reliability public service energy efficiency and 
environmentally favorable service when compared to any other mode of 
transporting energy  We have learned from our experiences research and 
mistakes in the past and will continue to learn in the future so that future 
pipeline service will be even better for our people whom we serve  

Our entire energy pipeline industry natural gas and petroleum needs to 
shape the issues in the national press and tell our very good story so the 
politicians are not overrun with public opinion shaped by our maritime 
competition 

Thanks for your interest  This is a headsup that is probably not needed 
but I felt that there might be something in it that would help with a very 
difficult current and future issue

EMail Subject GlobalCashExchange can establish Enron with corporate CFOs  
and treasurers worldwide


Dear Jeff

I have worked with Ken Lay and others at Enron through the World Economic  
Development Congress where we brought together ministers of finance and oil  
immediately prior to the IMF World Bank Meeting 

InfrastructureWorld of which I am cofounder and vice chairman has 
recently  received  million each in funding from the IFC division of the 
World Bank and  Bechtel GlobalCashExchange is a separate but related 
business We have the  plan the experienced management team and proven 
technology and we will be  selecting major financial institution as a 
partner 

At the request of our corporate CFOs we are developing an internet based  
exchange for foreign exchange shortterm cash and credit that could give 
Enron  a powerful product to sell to corporations worldwide I have attached 
and  executive summary and a business plan I would like to discuss this with 
you at  your earliest convenience

Major sources of trade development and investment friction and inefficiency  
in large developing countries in particular include the facilitation of 
foreign  exchange short term cash credit and working capital transactions 
This is a  source of high cost and frustration even for major global 
corporations and for  middle and smaller corporations these are even greater 
burdens Today there are  no reliable and continuous flowing price sources 
for softer currencies as there  are for hard currencies Even the larger soft 
currencies like the Real or Rupee  are quoted only  to  times a day on 
Reuters and the only spot quotes are  available from traders who are 
motivated to benefit from a large spread The  GlobalCashExchange will allow 
buyers to transact at the middle of the interbank  spread There are lots of 
Internet based foreign exchanges and none that I have  actually seen support 
buyer to buyer transactions

GlobalCashExchange will develop an Internet based exchange for foreign  
exchange short term cash and credit The goal is to reduce costs of such  
transactions Global Cash Exchange can also greatly enhance capital 
formation  and the formation of local capital markets in developing 
countries This is a  large and complex undertaking where we will need to be 
partnering with one or a  group of major financial institutions like 
Citibank Cantor Fitzgerald State  Street Bank Schwab and the World Bank 

As you know the Foreign Exchange FX market is the largest and most  
participated financial market in the world with over  trillion exchanges  
daily throughout the world There is no central market place for FX  
transactions all FX transactions are conducted through a network of banks  
dealers and brokers Approximately   of FX transactions involve banks 
dealing  directly with each other The potential market for short term cash 
and credit  which will ultimately reduce the need for foreign exchange 
transactions  is  even larger

We are funding this internally and are starting to develop outside investor  
support We have established great partnerships with organizations such as  
Standard  Poors and Medley Global Advisors  http  wwwmedleyadvisorscom
 for ratings and content on the site VMAC a  division of FSA that has 
patented the concept of providing pooled credit  enhancement facilities 
http  wwwfsacom for revolving credit enhancement  facilities and 
GenPartners http  wwwgenpartnerscom for strategic and  technological 
advice Transactions that cannot be matched can be cleared through  
Deerhurst a leading foreign exchange fund manager who has agreed to provide  
liquidity from day one We also know that we can purchase insurance for 
around   billion of annual transactions for just under M a year GCX is 
now at a  point that it has answered most of the questions that we had We 
have a  commitment from Ashton Technologies for full build out of SEC 
approved  technology in exchange for equity This technology has been used 
successfully  for more complex securities transactions and allows for many 
equity market  facilities that Forex markets do not currently have such as 
reserve book limit  order and so forth A description of the Ashton 
technology and an executive  summary that we use for our corporate clients 
are attached 

We have good corporate support through World Research Advisory WRA an  
affiliated provider of research for corporate treasurers WRA supplies 
Gartner  and Forrester type subscription research and advisory services to 
global   companies The contact list includes the CFOs of the following 
companies many  of whom have agreed to participate in the Global Cash 
Exchange

what FERC did today  One question you need to think about is how their 
decision on price caps affects any contracts which we may have indexed to 
Californias spot market  The way it reports the market clearing price will 
change fundamentally if prices over  will be accepted but not used to 
clear the market for all bids  So if we are using this as a reference price 
in our contracts it may trigger the need to look for alternatives

USA FACTBOXFERC details changes for Calif power market

  
Reuters English News Service
C Reuters Limited 

WASHINGTON Nov  Reuters  The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
on Wednesday approved several actions to revamp Californias power market 
over the next two years 
Immediate changes include the following
 Eliminate requirement that three utilities  Pacific Gas  Electric San 
Diego Power and SoCal Edison  must sell all of their power to and buy all 
their power from the state Power Exchange PX 
 Require market participants to schedule  percent of their transactions in 
the dayahead markets to reduce chronic underscheduling of load and 
generation and overreliance on the ISOs realtime imbalance market to meet 
supply FERC also proposed a penalty charge for scheduling deviations in 
excess of  percent of hourly load requirements 
 Temporary modification of the singleprice auction so bids above  MWh 
cannot set the market clearing price paid to all bidders 
 Establish independent nonstakeholder governing boards for the California 
Power Exchange PX and Independent System Operator ISO 
 Create congestion management design proposal 
 Establish generation interconnection procedures 
 Explore alternatives to the single price auction by the ISO and PX 
 Develop market rules to ensure sufficient supply is available to meet load 
and reserve requirements 
FERC also approved changes to protect wholesale customers from unreasonable 
rates during the time it will take to adopt longerterm market remedies The 
following price mitigation measures will remain in effect until Dec  
 
 Singleprice auctions for all sales in the ISO and PX markets at or below 
 MWh The single price would be used for all load which clears below this 
amount in the auction 
 If an auction does not clear below the  MWh level suppliers who choose 
to bid above  would be paid their price bid In other words the highest 
bid of the day if above  per MWh would no longer be the clearing price 
paid by all 
 Sellers receiving above  per MWh would be required to report their bids 
to FERC on a weekly basis and provide certain cost information to the agency 
 The ISO and PX would be required to report monthly information on such 
bids allowing FERC to monitor competitive conditions and assure just and 
reasonable rates Sellers would be subject to potential refund liability but 
no lower than their marginal or opportunity cost if FERC finds 
noncompetitive conditions The potential refund liability would extend the 
full  months it would take to implement the market reforms

2000-11-01T09:15:00-08:00,"I think it looks good  a few suggestions though

I havent read the whole reprt so I cant say for sure that it alleges no 
price gouging make sure to forward this to Jeff  my email is slow on the 
road  We can say though that instead of blaming generators and marketers 
the report blames the structure of the market for Californias woes

I think we should shorten the quote to something like  the reprt is 
consistent with what we have said all along

We should say that the scheduling penalties part of the order will penalize 
utilities for underscheduling not predicting

Hedging is not about holding pirces down so much as it is about protecting 
people from wild price swings  thats what allowing utilities to buy 
outside the spot should help do

Once again I come to you for help  We were awarded a biosolids dewatering 
contract in Grand Rapids Michigan about a month ago  We had bid against the 
incumbent a company called Synagro  You may recall that Azurix is in 
litigation with Syangro over a busted acquisition but the two events are not 
related  In any case we were low bidder and the recommendation was made to 
award the contract to us  Synagro has been working to get the award 
overturned and appears to have been successful  It is not yet clear whether 
they are going to award the deal to Synagro or rebid  It is not even clear 
what the grounds are for overturning the award which indicates that it may 
be pure politics  

Do we have any good political consultants that could help us in Grand 
Rapids  We do not have much of a presence in that area and were responding 
to a publicly advertised bid  Price and technical qualifications were the 
only issues  Politics did not enter into it until now so we were caught a 
little flatfooted   

Any suggestions

Thanks for getting back to me so soon 

I think you did a good job of summarizing our discussions both as to content 
and context  I fully understand what your two most important issues are and 
that you are optimistic we can come together on the other issues  
Nevertheless the details are important as to all of those issues  I look 
forward to talking more both about the details and about the business 
elements that underlie our views of the issues  I agree that whatever 
happens as to outcome these kinds of discussions are far more beneficial 
than mutual demonization  

 I expect to be able to talk to my principles at EEI next Monday our 
Financial Conference is just finishing up in San Francisco  I understand 
Enron had someone there  Once I do I will get back to you 

In the meantime I m absorbing the California Order and would be glad to 
share impressions with you when we talk

Ed   


 Richard Shapiro     PM 


Ed Thanks again for breakfast and for the very  good discussion we had on a
wide ranging set of issues Heres where I believe we ended the discussion 

On the range of issues that were addressed in the document we forwarded to 
you
and that we worked from that would likely be addressed next congress relative
to electricity reform the bottom line was that while there were many issues 
on
which we voiced  our diffrences mandatory RTO participation and
nondiscriminatory access to transmissionieunbundling  are the two 
critical
issues from our perspective While our discussion revealed the continuing
diffrences we have on the resolution of those issues and the  political
hurdles EEI faces with certain of its members to reach consensus on them we
both felt further meetings and continued discussion were  warranted  On the
remaining issues  other than the two just mentioned  for which diffrences 
were
articulated and discussed I indicated that we fully understood your concerns
and that Enron was sufficiently flexible on those issues to have a high degree
of confidence that they would ultimately be  removed as a source of 
disagreement
between us  Again I come back to the two critical issues mentioned above 
those issues must be adequately addressed as laid out in our earlier document
for this process to come to fruition and for comprehensive federal legislation
to make any sense for us With that said remember that we were quite 
receptive

Ed
thanks again for taking the time to continue the dialogue despite the 
distance
on issues that still exists between our respective organizations I feel that
this is a doable exercise if the necessary commitment is made to the process 
No
matter the ultimate outcome I believe that one positive result  that has and
will continue to come from this process is a better understanding of our
respective viewpoints and a recognition that the mutual  demonization that has
occoured in the past is completely counterproductive Talk to you soon

Steve

Wanted to thank you again for reviewing the strategy as simple rules 
article  It is forthcoming in the next Harvard Business Review and will send 
you some reprints once the magazine hits the newsstands 

Also wanted to gauge your interest in a possible even at the Harvard Business 
School in April   We are currently finalizing our plans for the 
Entrepreneurial Managera first year course on entrepreneurship taken by all 
 of our MBA students  As part of the course we will feature an 
entrepreneurial company as the capstone class in the course  Last year we 
featured Intuit taught an Intuit case study and hosted Scott Cook who spoke 
to the entire MBA class  The session was a huge successthe highest rated 
class in our course and had a lasting impact on how our students think about 
entrepeneurship  We were wondering whether you and your colleagues might be 
interested in being our featured company this year  

If you decided to proceed we would first write a case study focused on the 
process of creating new ventures within Enron    The case would probably 
consist of three portions  an overview of the Enron corporation an indepth 
description of one or two ventures successfully formed in the past and a 
profile of someone currently attempting to start a new venture within 
Enron   In preparing the case we would draw heavily on existing case 
studies articles and book chapters profiling Enron to avoid duplicating 
effort   We would then supplement our desk research by interviewing 
approximately  Enron employees including top management team members 
especially Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling some folks involved in past ventures 
and the people currently attempting to start a new venture  Each interview 
would take approximately  minutes  We could probably complete the bulk of 
the interviews in a two to three day visit to Enron supplemented by 
telephone interviews  The ideal timing for these interviews from our 
perspective would be the last week of November or the first few weeks of 
December  We would then return to Boston write a draft of the case and then 
submit that to you for review and clearance in January  We could then make 
any last minute changes before distributing the case to the students for the 
April discussion  

In addition to writing the case study we would like to invite a group of 
Enron executives to HBS when we discuss the case in April    The ideal date 
would be the th of April but we could schedule the Enron day the rd 
th or th if the th were impossible for you  Last year Intuit sent 
along six folkssome junior some senioreach of whom sat in at least one 
of our class discussions  In addition Scott Cook spoke to the entire MBA 
class  We would like to follow the same format this year so it would be 
super if either Jeff or Ken or in the best of all worlds both could speak 
to the MBAs as a whole  With Intuit last year we kicked off at about  
and wrapped everything up by approximately   We would shoot for roughly 
similar timing this year  

Many of our students equate entrepreneurship with startups and this day is 
designed to show them that it is possible although extremely difficult for 
large companies to be entrepreneurial  As such you and your colleagues 
would be providing an invaluable service to our students and we would be 
deeply grateful for your contribution  The event might also have some direct 
benefits to Enron in terms of increased profile among our students  If you 
were interested we could also explore opportunities to leverage this event 
to further increase Enrons profile as a leader of the New Economy  We 
might for instance bundle the case study with a teaching note and edited 
video as a module on entrepreneurship in large companies and distribute it 
to other business schools through Harvard Business School press  My 
colleagues and I would be most grateful for your cooperation and would be 
happy to explore ways that you might increase your return on the time 
invested  

Please let me know if this opportunity might be of interest to you and your 
colleagues and how you would like to proceed  I very much look forward to 
hearing from you

As a follow up to your  email I spoke to Janet Butler again about the ability 
to view FERC meetings  Jan told me that the password is not tied to one 
location  The password works for all locations  A location equals a 
person user  The only requirement is to have Real Video access which Jan 
informs me is on the ENA Lan  My understanding from Jan Butler is that the 
cost is  per user location per month

I will send the request to Jan to add two users locations per your request  
Jan will need names for the locations  Do you want the locations to be in 
your name and Steves or how do you want to set that up

Subject Re FERC Meetings  

Eric  A couple of questions

 Is the subscription dedicated to a particular user name or is it something 
like a membership number It would be helpful to be able to be able to watch 
the big meetings on one of the plasma screens which would work with either 
login method  If the subscription is tied to a membership number we could 
use any machine as the projecting machine
 Is Real Video part of the Enron standard offering special software that 
wed need to order or a freebie we can download like RealPlayer

Thanks

Mr Kean  

Per your request I spoke to Janet Butler yesterday after the FERC meeting on 
options available to our group to view FERC meetings  Janet told me that 
Shelleys group has an annual contract with Capitol Connection that costs 
 plus  for every additional connection annually  The contract is 
being renewed in the next week  Janet indicated that Shelleys group pays 
the charges and bills to our cost center

Capitol Connection allows access to all other FERC meetings such as the 
California Wholesale Conference   We need to have Real Video access in order 
to view the meetings

John Stokes Laird Smith and I spoke with Eric Schneidewind this afternoon  
Varnum is currently representing the city on isolated matters  Varnum is 
approaching the city attorney to obtain a waiver of any conflict of interest 
so that they may engage in lobbying activities on Azurixs behalf  Eric is 
very confident that the city attorney will issue with waiver  Varnum made it 
clear that should Azurix lose the contract and wish to engage in any legal 
action against the city then Azurix would not be able to use Varnum b c of 
their existing relationship with the city  John assured Eric that it is 
extremely unlikely that Azuriz would ever pursue legal action against the 
city

John Stokes has asked that Varnum deal directly with Tom Maxwell in the 
Edmonton office once the waiver is obtained

They will keep us posted on progress

I have spoken with Eric Schneidewind our attorney at Varnum Riddering 
Schmidt and Howlett in Lansing  He is contacting other attorneys in the firm 
to follow up on this immediately  Varnum is one of the two major west 
Michigan law firms and is based in Grand Rapids  

John Stokes and I have spoken  As soon as I learn anything from our 
attorneys I will be in contact with him

I also have a call into our lobbying firm Karoub Associates  I doubt that 
they could be more effective than Varnum on this one but I want them in the

		 Subject Help in Michigan

Once again I come to you for help  We were awarded a biosolids dewatering 
contract in Grand Rapids Michigan about a month ago  We had bid against the 
incumbent a company called Synagro  You may recall that Azurix is in 
litigation with Syangro over a busted acquisition but the two events are not 
related  In any case we were low bidder and the recommendation was made to 
award the contract to us  Synagro has been working to get the award 
overturned and appears to have been successful  It is not yet clear whether 
they are going to award the deal to Synagro or rebid  It is not even clear 
what the grounds are for overturning the award which indicates that it may 
be pure politics  

Do we have any good political consultants that could help us in Grand 
Rapids  We do not have much of a presence in that area and were responding 
to a publicly advertised bid  Price and technical qualifications were the 
only issues  Politics did not enter into it until now so we were caught a 
little flatfooted   

Any suggestions

2000-11-06T00:24:00-08:00," John Sherriff and I are recommending Carol Hensley VP Marketing and 
Communications at Azurix for a VP position in Johns organization  Carol 
was a director in the Enron PR group before moving to Azurix  Her new role 
would be to support EnronCreditcom  A critical success factor for 
EnronCreditcom will be to establish a strong brand in the coming months

 In her time at Azurix Carol has added significantly to her skills and 
experience  I spoke with John Garrison at length about Carols performance 
at Azurix  She has expanded her marketing services skills and provided 
significant support in the investor relations arena  Garrison relates that 
the Azurix commercial leaders view Carol as a partner informed about the 
business and instrumental in handling crises and pursuing business 
opportunities

 John Sherriff and Ken Lay join me in recommending that Carol keep her VP 
title as she returns to Enron

  Guess the warnings were true Federal Bill P cents per Email
  Sent  It figures No more free Email We knew this was coming
 
  Bill P will permit the Federal Government to charge a cent charge
on
  every
  delivered Email
 
  Please read the following carefully if you intend to stay online  and
  continue using Email The last few months have revealed an alarming
  trend in the Government of the United States attempting to quietly push
  through legislation that will effect our use of the Internet Under
 proposed
  legislation the US Postal Service will be attempting to bill Email
users
  out of alternative postage fees Bill P will permit the Federal
  Government
  to charge a cent surcharge on every EMail delivered by billing
 Internet
  Service Providers at source The consumer would then be billed in turn
by
 the
  ISP
 
  Washington DC lawyer Richard Stepp is working without pay to prevent
this
  legislation from becoming law The US Postal Service is claiming lost
  revenue due to the proliferation of Email is costing nearly

  in revenue per year You may have noticed their recent ad campaign
  There is nothing like a letter Since the average person received
about
   pieces of Email per day in  the cost of the typical individual
 would
  be an additional  cents a day  or over  per year  above and
beyond
  their regular Internet costs Note that this would be money paid
directly
 to
  the US Postal Service for a service they do not even provide The whole
 point
  of the
  Internet is democracy and noninterference You are already paying an
  exorbitant
  price for snail mail because of bureaucratic efficiency It currently
 takes
  up to  days for a letter to be delivered from coast to coast If the US
  Postal Service is allowed to tinker with Email it will mark the end of
 the
  free Internet in the United States Our Congressional representative
 Tony
  Schnell R has even suggested a  per month surcharge on all
 Internet
  service above and beyond the governments proposed Email charges Note
 that
  most of the major newspapers have ignored the story  the only exception
  being the Washingtonian  which called the idea of Email surcharge a
 useful
  idea whos time has come    March th  Editorial
 
  Do not sit by and watch your freedom erode away Send this to Email to
  EVERYONE on your list and tell all your friends and relatives write
 their
  congressional representative and say NO to Bill P It will only
take
 a
  few moments of your time and could very well be instrumental in killing
  a bill we do not want     Please forward

Subject Re Security Assessment Report  

Gabriel et al

Looks like the risks to Enron travelers to and employees in Colombia have 
increased  This is another indication that a travel policy for travelers 
to Colombia should be in effect  What happened to the one we were discussing 
earlier  The steps outlined there would go a long way in improving the 
security of our travelers

Control Risks report discusses responses to the media  be sure you have the 
approval of Enrons media people before making any response

The report also recommends suspending bidding on new projects  probably not 
viable advice but reinforces the importance that additional security 
measures be built into all new projects from day one

Now that our name is in front of the Colombian public we could see 
retaliation for various acts not all of which we have control over  Recent 
US Government actions such as extraditing criminals to the US for trial and 
training Colombian antidrug troops have done little to endear American 
businesses to the Colombian public who see such actions as interfering with 
Colombias right to govern themselves  These actions have significantly 
raised the risk of all American companies and their employees in Colombia

A meeting I had about two years ago with David Beddow of Control Risks in 
Bogota indicated that we could see some changes in the methods of attack in 
urban areas by FARC ELN  With an elevated risk level we should begin 
thinking about these threats  FARC seldom uses the car bomb method of attack 
because it generates little interest among the domestic or international 
media  FARC plans on using letter bombs mailed to select targets ie head 
of an Americanowned corporation who may have an office in Bogota  This 
method will generate headlines in the press and generate a fear of FARC among

Subject descriptors again

Dick here is another try at the descriptors  I tried to apply the 
information you provided and to describe qualities of an employees 
performance  Im  not sure whether this is any better but would appreciate 
your input  What I am finding most challenging writing descriptors which are 
interchangeable with all levels and job groups within the company  The 
behaviors these describe and measure need to be general in nature so that 
they can apply to a VP and an admin assistant as well as to all four Peer 
Groups within Enron  

Likewise I would appreciate your thoughts on the necessity value of changing 
the feedback forms to reflect the same numerical ratings  presently the 
feedback forms use the same descriptors as the cluster ie Superior  
Issues  In your opinion should these also be  ratings with one  to 
highest and  to lowest in scale  
I look forward to hearing your thoughts and impressions  You may either 
email me or call me on    Many thanks in advance Gina

This is a good summary of the scope of Joses responsibilities and the value 
he manages  This obviously takes a lot of my time as well because of its 
importance in some ways  like you or Stan Horton in terms of drivers of my 
PL  However Jose manages this pretty much on his own without much 
involvement from Houston it is a local effort by its nature which was the 
point I was making at the PRC  He has a good grasp of the commercial 
regulatory and political elements of all of this and keeps them all balanced 
well  He is methodical and systematic which can also be perceived as not 
especially dynamic and English is really his second language which may 
have hurt him in the PRC  He is on the job I would wager as much as  hours 
a week  Do we have anyone at his level with as much or more responsibility 
elsewhere in the company

We have revised the PRC Cluster descriptors again in an attempt to include 
relativity into the language  Likewise  for consistency we opted  not to 
change them too drastically at the year end  Instead we will look at making 
other changes for example reducing the number of clusters from  to  
and or changing the wording  at the midyear 

The VP PRC Committee had a chance to look at the revised clusters at last 
weeks meeting  However I apologize that I did not send them to you in

Enron PAC contributed  for her primary race she had no race and

She has been helpful on several issues this year such as HB Visa and was in 
India with President Clinton at which she spoke to the Power Minister in a 
helpful way Ken Lay and others jawboned her to get her vote in favor of PNTR 
for China although I think she was bargaining with everyone as she frequently 
does Chris Long has developed a good relationship with Shiela but she seldom 
seeks us out and I think her delayed position on PNTR for China was 
unbecoming a representative from Houston Houston will gain from PNTR for

2000-11-01T07:59:00-08:00,"I think paul has a number of good suggestions here  I think that tying 
rankings to clear objectives does not reflect the fluidity of our charge 
though and will lead to expectations which may not be met  I also feel 
strongly that the ranking needs to be a relative one  I would go to a pure 
number system  We are going to need to assess at each PRC whether the 
organization is strong in which case I think its ok to have a 
disproportionate number of high ratings or whether the organization has 
weaknesses that force us to grade tougher  You dont get that in an absolute 
system with preset expectations  I think your group in particular has done a 
good job of emphasizing team work  and punishing those who dont play well 
so we need not create a competitive or jockeying environment so long as that 
emphasis is communicated explicitly

I agree with Pauls points about giving clear specific feed back though I 
dont think we can give a clear target for what one must accomplish to be 
superior  I also like the idea of the abbreviated mid year PRC to deal with 
those we need to counsel more vigorously  Im not sure we can get away with 
it but I am willing to give it a shot

I think Paul is to be complimented for taking time to focus on the larger 
organizational issues  very vice presidential of him no overstepping 
of bounds  quite the contrary

a wide variety of approaches  What we specifically discussed and what scott 
s left prepared and committed to do involved looking at individual curves 
the assumptions underlying them and some process yet to be specifically 
determined for addressing updates  We agreed to start with the top  
curves and especially those which are involved in the upcoming deals

I think the confusion is in what the term validation means  In the ENA

Scott 

We should talk about what was agreed to at the meeting  

My discussions with others indicated that both a a curve validation process 
and b a dealbydeal review would be undertaken  The dealbydeal review 
is especially critical during the implementation of a structured curve 
validation process  In addition even when the curve validation process is 
fully up and running we should continue looking at major position impacts in 
new transactions  There are many curves to review  It seems reasonable to 
look at the critical rate curves as appropriate

In the interest of clarity  It was agreed that ongoing curve validation

was further agreed that certain information would be provided by Scott

Subject EES  RAC Deal Approval Meeting

I received word late last week that Dave Gorte works for Rick Buy is 
setting up a meeting to discuss the process under which EES will have its 
deals considered by RAC

I think that we should argue that the following package of information be 
preassembled and provided to Govt Affairs when EES brings a deal to RAC

 List of each position by utility and by rate class within the deal 

 Regulated Rate forecasts by utility and by rate class for each position in 
the deal  Not just the scalars but also the absolute  Mwh

 For each impacted position the key assumptions contained within the 
curves  
 a deregulation date if any
 b stranded cost rolloff date if any
 c standard offer end date if any
 d other rate reduction dates and amounts if any

 Revenue side or Cost side contract terms that impact the deal for 
example movement in pricing terms given some event

I also think that we should have at least  working days to review this 
package  

If anyone can think of anything else that would ease our analysis I would be 
game

Thanks

November  
Calif RegulatorsGrid Oper In Turf War Over Generation By JASON LEOPOLD Of 
DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELESCalifornias electricity regulators and 
powergrid operator are locked in a turf war over who has the authority to 
order new power plant construction next summer to ensure the state has 
enough juice on hand when demand soars
The California Public Utilities Commission says it can bring emergency 
power on line at a fraction of the cost that the Independent System 
Operator is expected to pay independent power producers for the same 
service
Under its plan PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas  Electric Co Edison 
Internationals EIX Southern California Edison unit and Sempra Energys 
SRE San Diego Gas  Electric Co were ordered to submit documents by the 
end of November stating whether they can build and operate peaking plants 
by June 
The utilities werent immediately available to comment
On the other hand the ISO  which is on the verge of signing contracts for 
 peaking units with between  and  megawatts of electricity  says 
the commissions meddling could endanger any chance of additional resources 
coming on line in time
Any further interference on the state level could destroy the plan 
altogether said an ISO source close to the issue There is no guarantee 
the utilities will be able to pull this off by next summer And if the 
whole project is scrapped you can expect there will be blackouts
Interference by federal regulators has already cost the ISO two 
participants and nearly  megawatts in its peaking program
Calpine Corp CPN and Enron ENE initially agreed to build peaking 
plants for the ISO next summer but withdrew their offers after the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission proposed capping the clearing price for 
Californias wholesale electricity market at  a megawatthour
The ISO which operates one of the states wholesale power markets and 
manages most of the highvoltage transmission grid has already solicited 
and received bids from merchant generators for  megawatts of new 
peaking power for next summer
Burned by the summers power crisis and facing an MW shortfall next 
summer the ISO put out a request for bids in August The ISOs board voted 
Oct  to enter into the contracts which it estimated would cost about 
 million a year for three years
The states Electricity Oversight Board which oversees the performance of 
the ISO and the Public Utilities Commission protested the decision on the 
grounds that the contracts were too expensive
The commission is also questioning whether there is even a need for peaking 
power next summer and if there is whether the ISO should handle the 
solicitation
The question also arises as to whether the ISO  which is empowered only 
to operate the states transmission system and which does not represent the 
state or its consumers  is the appropriate organization to plan solicit 
and pay for the construction of new power plants across the state the 
commission wrote in its Nov  order
Ind the end the decision is up to state regulators If utilities can come 
up with a cheaper alternative and if the regulators determine that 
additional generation is needed by next summer then they will follow 
through with the utilities proposal

		 Subject Re BackWeb

Steve

At this point our IT contacts are backpedalling a bit and suggesting they 
can overcome the TIBCO and Terminal Server problems  There are still four 
important issues however

IT still cannot commit to transferring messages across domains  This means 
that messages initiated at Corp and intended for the entire Enron 
organization will not reach any business units outside the Corp domain
No messages will reach the EES organization unless IBM agrees not to use 
their proprietary message delivery tool WebSphere and will use WebLogic 
instead  WebLogic is required by BackWeb although it is designed by a 
separate company
HR intended to be a key user of this tool will not use BackWeb because 
survey responses cannot be made anonymous  HR has already purchased a tool 
called CONFIRMIT that can execute anonymous surveys
Messages will not be delivered simultaneously to all users in the same 
domain nor will they be delivered for two to five hours after they are sent 
by the message administrator

Another thing to consider is that these messages will be set to expire and 
disappear within a set period of time meaning users cannot retrieve them and 
read them later as they can with email  This means that I could be away 
from the office for several days and miss a message entirely because it 
would have expired and disappeared by the time I returned

The plain fact is that a few members of IT are pushing this initiative but 
they lack commercial sponsorship  They are hoping Corp will foot the bill 
for a pilot which will allow them to fully test this tool before implementing 
it companywide

Please let us know if you have additional questions

2000-11-12T23:51:00-08:00,"There are a few other issues we need to look into

Larcamp told Hartsoe and I after the meeting that FERC may clarify that the 
price caps and reporting obligations apply only to bids into the PX and ISO 
 ie no bilateral transaction will be subject to the requirements  He asked 
if knowing this would change any of our views esp peaking plants though I 
suspect its already too late for that  My gut reaction is that so long as 
the market continues to clear through the centralized exchanges this 
exemption for bilateral transactions wont matter much but lets think it 
through  Is EOL or APX an alternative
Massey specifically asked us to address forward markets in our comments  
Specifically has FERC done everything it can to encourage forward market 
development  In addition to any other points we might make I think we 
should argue that PJMing the market wont facilitate and may even hinder 
forward market development  Also we should advocate actions by FERC that 
take away secondguessing by the CPUC in order to reduce utility fears about 
contracting forward
We have to give the Commission a way out on price caps  We need to think 
through whether there is something we can live with here or we should take 
the approach I took in my testimony  FERC should encourage the state to 
provide rate protection for selected customer classes by putting those 
requirements up for bid ie get the utility out of the commodity business as 
much as possible
Finally on governence issues we should argue for a narrowe role for the ISO 
as a way of diffusing the emotional governence debate  Analogy  if the ISO 
is simply the air traffic controller all parties will simply be interested in 
retaining the most technically competent people not hiring or appointing 
their lackies or friends  So long as the ISO has a role in setting prices 
acquiring supplies or running the market it is destined to be controversial 
and highly politicized  Those functions should be left to the market

		 Subject Thank You

Steve

Thanks for arranging a great afternoon yesterday   I very much enjoyed our
conversation on people and idea generation as well as gaining a good
overview of Enrons key businesses The tour was extremely educational and
we had a good discussion with Nate Ellis on Retail Services at the end of
the day

I like your idea of getting the top executives together at some point soon 
 I know our Chairman Chuck Knight would be very fascinated with the
transformation at Enron and your business models for future growth He also
loves to share and contrast different management processes and I think all
involved would take away some ideas to consider David Farr our new CEO
would gain much from such an interaction and hopefully the establishment of
a long relationship between our firms and executive teams

On top of this I see a tremendous potential for our firms to work together
in a number of key areas where our product and service technologies would
complement the Enron offering of market making and risk management I
appreciate your offer to help navigate some contacts to evaluate some of
these opportunities Some initial impressions include

 Evaluating the use of Energy Services on a broad scale at Emerson
operations

 Evaluating the solution package that we could jointly put together for
industrial customers with your Energy Services group and our remotely
controllable transfer switch UPS and backup power technologies that would
permit remote Enron control of whether a site is on off the grid or even
selling power back to the grid

 Evaluate the potential packages of Emerson systems measuring devices
control elements power diagnostic remote monitoring and visualization
products and technologies for use with Energy Services contract offerings 
 especially in specific vertical markets such as retail stores grocery
stores pipelines paper plants  semiconductor fabs etc We have over 
service and solutions people spread throughout USA and other world markets
which could support this effort

 Enron Broadband Services is already a primary user of Emerson fiber optic
conduit precision air conditioning UPS and other power and connectivity
products and services   we can evaluate how we can extend our technology
platform to support the bandwidth market making activity and the content
offering of Enron

 I also see some potential for Enron finance and risk management in
international infrastructure projects such as the Caspian Sea gas
development   where it looks like there will be  years of gas
production   some of the local customers who are intrigued with embracing
our new PlantWeb Fields technologies for better yield uptime asset
management have had trouble getting conventional project finance resources
to support their projects Given Enron understands what to do with gas in
kind there could be a very interesting triangular arrangement with Enron
Emerson and local gas production companies

These are some initial thoughts   I expect there may be several other
interesting possibilities come to light as we start to have additional
conversations

Steve again thanks for the arrangements yesterday and I will be back to
you shortly to organize a followup set of conversations

Best Regards

from timetotime whether we would be better off with a pure loads pay

approving the hiring of the Hills firm and I look forward to meeting with 
you and Carla as we discussed but remain hopeful we can use their services 
for something other than WTO  In the wake of Seattle and as I have come to 
understand better what the WTO can and cannot do for us on the energy 
services front I have come to the view that our talent and money would be 
better spent on other activities  My inclination is to do the bare minimum 
necessary to keep the machine going  If we have specifically committed to 
certain things then lets follow through  If there are things we can avoid 
lets avoid them  Specifically with respect to Fischer going to Geneva Why 
not have him available by phone at all hours to provide assistance and mage

Subject Enron and the Energy Services Issue Before The WTO

Steve This is a brief extension of our conversation yesterday afternoon 
putting in print some of the upcoming dates and possible committments for 
your consideration and decision

We have no exit strategy at this time and in order to follow your general 
instructions to withdraw gradually Im not quite certain that is possible at 
this stage you need to know the following

The April meeting at the WTO in Geneva Committee on Specific Committments 
spent considerable time discussing how energy services would be considered in 
the WTO GATS General Agreement on Trade and Services  The USTR raised the 
issue tabled the issue and guided the discussion We did not send anyone to 
that session

As planned for several months we issued the Rachel Thompson study which is 
completing its basic distribution now There has already been considerable 
interest in the study and I fully expect it to generate discussion in the 
days ahead I have sent you the correspondence from the Japanese Ministry 
Tonight I am hosting a small dinner for the top staff person for the leading 
Japanese business organization affiliated with the CSI organization He 
raised the issue of Japans industry feeling energy services was going too 
fast too soon when Ken addressed the WTO Ministerial Forum last December in 
Seattle Now he has told Bob Vastine president of CSI that he was told later 
by his collegues that his statement was a misstatement Well hear more 
tonight

Later today the ESC Executive Committee is meeting with the DOE to discuss 
how they can support energy services for the USTR who has lacked technical 
advisers since Donna Bobbich and Russ Profozich left DOE earlier this year 
DOE has appointed a group to help USTR and this is an orientation meeting 
held at their request

Next week I have scheduled the first ESC full meeting since January to update 
members now  since Schlumberger joined on Friday on developments which is 
essentially a report by USTR Carol Balassa who is the responsible official 
handling energy services

She has given a couple of us a debriefing on what happened at the WTO meeting 
and a request to prepare more detailed information for the May  meeting in 
Geneva where she tells us that energy services will be even more involved in 
the discussion We should have Bob Fisher go to that meeting to be of 
assistance This is a decision point for you

We have made some other committments which are also decision points although 
the Helsinki meeting on June th has been agreed upon based on my feelings 
that when I discussed it the SCO FSN Showcase Europe in Houston with you 
and Rick you raised no objection which I took as agreeing that it should go 
forward  We have done this meeting annually where I have brought in someone 
from Enron companies to brief them and host them for dinner These are the 
commercial people in the US embassies throughout Europe and the former Soviet 
Union They are important points of contact for our commercial people  This 
year they want to have energy services in the WTO and as we would like them 
to exist in their territory A few members of the ESC Executive Committee 
will do the former and Peter Styles the later I have organized the dinner

Following that meeting is one that EC Trade staffer Uta Klinkers wants the 
ESC Executive Committee to put on in Brussels which is a joint meeting she is 
organizing with European energy industry representatives This is a dialogue 
on energy services The EU is an important player in the WTO and Uta who 
recently met with the ESC Executive Committee in Washington is quite 
supportive of liberalized energy services At the EC she reports directly to 
Commissioner Pascal Lamy Ricks memo this week suggested we have Peter 
Styles do this briefing Peter is not an American and is not affiliated with 
the ESC Therefore unless we participate Europes energy industry is not 
talking with US industry If this is what you want then I should tell Uta 
that we are unable to do the meeting

The last meeting is the presentation by Ken Lay at the OECD Forum  on 
June  which I engineered with Doug Worth Secretary General of the BIAC 
Business Industry Affairs Committee to the OECD This is a major world 
conference and Ken is addressing ecommerce and services Doug an American 
and former head of the Washington IBM office wants to have Ken meet with OECD 
Commissioners in a smaller meeting to discuss trends for the future  I had 
planned to be there with Ken for the day day and a half he will be in Paris 
I introduced our company to the OECD several years ago and it has become 
increasingly involved in issues of interest to us

Well these are the nearterm items that require your fine hand if we are to 
proceed A dramatic drop off at this time will have its effects and no one is 
likely to pick up our leadership There is growing support for what has been 
accomplished and the USG plus others are now hooked on the energy services 
agenda I cannot easily see an exit strategy that can do anything but cause 
criticism at this point This is definately a longer term committment that I 
thought we had made when approval was given to hire the Hills firm However 
if you want to exit other than pulling back from the Brussels meeting I 
think the other meetings are firm committements at this point

These are some thoughts for your consideration and decision

One thing to add to the arguments  we have to make the adverse effect on 
consumers the centerpiece of our arguments  We need the legal arguments too 
but this is fundamentally a political and consumer protection driven 
discussion  We have to be prepared to demonstrate that the key to Alberta 
reducing prices is allowing new generation to enter and to do that you have 
to allow a true market price to be posted  California has seen the 
cancellation of numerous projects while they remain desparate for new supply 
because they have tried to artificially constrain prices  Thats not good 
for consumers  If they need a lower cost solution for consumers or 
protection from price volatility in the meantime they need to outsource 
the residential supply business in blocks for fixed price bids

Regardless of how we frame the arguments or the solutions however we have 
to make the public policy  consumer protection arguments the center of our 
written and oral presentations

Do you agree

		 Subject Update  Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes

Dale McMaster called this afternoon to advise that the Power Pool Council 
agreed to delay any decision on the recently proposed rule changes importers 
excluded from setting pool price and dispatch risk for a period of two 
weeks  During this two week period Dale has been asked to obtain stakeholder 
input into ways to address concerns about whether the spot price in the 
Alberta Power Pool is a product of interaction among competitiors in a 
efficient market   

In our discussions with the Power Pool and ADRD today and yesterday Enron 
expressed its willingness to work with the Power Pool to provide feedback on 
suggested rule changes but has also made it clear that we do not agree with 
the premise that there is a problem that requires emergency amendments to 
the Pool rules  Our position has been that Alberta is short supply and 
significant changes to the rules and or market design will only discourage 
new generation development 

Dale McMaster had just left the Power Pool Council meeting when he called and 
had not yet put much thought into how to define the issue he has to address 
and what the process will be   We discussed the process and it appears he 
will likely receive comments from stakeholders at large and also assemble a 
small committee of  stakeholders which would include Enron to work with 
the Power Pool to consider possible changes to the Pool rules  Dale said he 
would try to pull together a terms of reference document that would define 
the mandate of the small committee by tomorrow

After my call with Dale McMaster Peter Keohane and I spoke to Aleck Trawick 
and we have asked Blakes to assist us in three areas

 Once the terms of reference of this small committee are released and 
assuming Enron is asked to participate on the committee Blakes will assist 
us with preparing a letter that states that Enrons participation does not 
represent acknowledgement or agreement that the Power Pool Rules must be 
amended to address the concerns of some stakeholders about real time pricing 
in Alberta and that Enrons participation on the committee is on a without 
prejudice basis

 Enron needs to obtain the final memo from Frontier Economics in which 
Frontier provides its opinion on how the proposed rule changes i would 
introduce price discrimination into the Alberta electricity market ii would 
be contrary to the development of an efficient fair and openly competitive 
market for electricity iii would compromise the independence of the Power 
Pool and iv would have the expected effect of artificially depressing the 
real time price of electricity in Alberta  Once Blakes receives a copy of 
the Frontier Economics memo they will prepare a memo for Enron advising i 
whether the two week process of consultation by the Power Pool is in 
accordance with the standards required of the PPC as an administrative 
tribunal operating in Alberta and ii whether such rule changes offend the 
provisions of the EUA

 Blakes will advise Enron of the possible avenues of recourse ie appeal 
to the AEUB and or legal action in the Court of Queens Bench in the event 
the proposed rule changes or similar changes are approved by the PPC at the 
end of this two week period   GPC and Eric Thode will also be consulted on 
this issue and obviously input from all those within Enron working on this 
project will be sought prior to any decision being made to pursue any 
possible legal remedies  

Please advise if you have any comments

Regards

Rob

Steve

Thank you for taking the time to see me whenever I have requested an 
appointment with you I believe there are discussions to consolidate Enron 
websites and also to develop a Knowledge Management infrastructure  You and 
I have shared some thoughts on these subjects Properly managed these are 
potent tools in the strategic mix that would help keep Enron innovative I 
know that no concrete plans have yet emerged from your deliberations but I 
can foresee when you might want someone to lead this effort full time

It is eminently sensible to move towards consolidation in both areas Among 
the several benefits a common infrastructure would sharply reduce both 
development and maintenance costs  Also we would eliminate duplications and 
give coherence to the look and feel of websites that would emphasize 
corporate branding  

I am doing some great things here at EBS and generally speaking I am happy 
Nevertheless I see a tremendous potential in this role and very much would 
like to be considered a prime candidate for the lead position in this effort 
Everything I have done here at Enron has richly prepared me for this 
position My relationship with business units has given me a unique 
education  I have developed information value chain built and managed three 
websites in three different operating companies At all times my products 
were considered benchmarks In addition I shall be able to manage potential 
political problems that are likely to attend any consolidation 

I should be grateful if you would think about this 

Once again thank you for your time

		 Subject Mkt Affiliate Implications Reorganization of Houston and Omaha 
Facilities Management Responsibilities



Enron Energy Services is presently a marketing affiliate of several of the 
Enron pipelines because EES  buys sells gas and  holds transport 
contracts on our pipelines  

Under the FERCs standards of conduct the pipelines cannot  share 
transportation information or shipper information with EES  must function 
independently and keep separate books and records  Generally I dont see 
the FERC having any problem with mechanical electrical airconditioning 
types of services  However there are  specific concerns that arise with 
respect to the described arrangement under the FERCs marketing affiliate 
standards of conduct

 Records  FERC has ruled that giving a marketing affiliate access to 
transportation and shipper records including something as simple as file 
room access is deemed to be impermissibly sharing the information with a 
marketing affiliate in violation of the standards Thus it seems to me that 
EES will explicitly not be able to perform any records management function 
for NNG TW or NBPL

 Billing   FERC scrutinizes intercompany charges carefully  In a recent 
KinderMorgan consent order the FERC used payroll and intercompany charge 
records to make the case that the pipeline and marketing affiliate did not 
operate separately  It would be helpful if any EES facility management 
charges allocations come from Enron Facility Services not EES   leaving 
us room to argue that the facility management subsidiary involves separate 
functions and staff than the EES subsidiary that is a marketing affiliate

Subject Reorganization of Houston and Omaha Facilities Management 
Responsibilities


Responsibility  for daily operations of building support services in the

transitioning from Corporate to Enron Energy Services EES by yearend  The 
areas affected include facility operations and maintenance of mechanical 
electrical and airconditioning systems mail delivery  housekeeping  
food copier and records services

This transition of services as presently managed by Enron Property and

		 Subject Re Comments on FERC November  order

Just to pile on with the issues I will add a few thoughts of my own for 
issues that we might want to consider in our November  comments   
Re the application of the price cap to only PX and ISO Commissioner Massey 
is not totally on board  He specifically asked about capping the forward 
market  He raised the idea that he had gotten from the San Diego hearing 
that there be an accepted forward contract for a specified timeframe  
months and specified rate and that all loads must buy a minimum percentage 
of their needs from this contract
A staffer Don Gelinas asked whether the forward bilateral market 
presumably uncapped could take care of investment recovery so that 
generation not be cancelled in California
Dynegy and other marketers raised the issue of the test to be used by the 
Commission in reviewing transactions above the soft cap  Specifically what 
is opportunity cost  As long as the test is not known until after the fact 
there will be lack of secuity selling into the California and greater 
incentive to sell elsewhere
Hobbs from Williams raised the possibility that if the Commission does not 
eliminate the soft cap his preferred approach that the cap should be 
temporary and escalating and there should be limited time for raising issues 
and retaining the refund liability he suggested that the refund liability be 
only for one month
Many especially the utilities raised their position that the Commission 
should not institute penalties only on the load  They claimed this was 
onesided and suggested if penalties were required they needed to be applied 
to the supply side as well  They also argued that the load could not meet 
the  test
Massey had a concern at the end of the day that the Commissions 
encouragement of forward contracts will be stymied by the CPUC by their 
authority in reviewing prudence of the utilities purchases
Larcamp asked at the end of the day for information on the cost of generation 
before deregulation  normalized for gas prices and emmission prices of 
today  The marketer on the panel added that we would need to include 
stranded costs
There was almost no support for the single price auction in California
The California politicians argued that the ISO Board structure needed to be 
changed but that California had jurisdiction to change it not FERC  A 
Court battle was threatened

		 Subject Re Comments on FERC November  order

There are a few other issues we need to look into

Larcamp told Hartsoe and I after the meeting that FERC may clarify that the 
price caps and reporting obligations apply only to bids into the PX and ISO 
 ie no bilateral transaction will be subject to the requirements  He asked 
if knowing this would change any of our views esp peaking plants though I 
suspect its already too late for that  My gut reaction is that so long as 
the market continues to clear through the centralized exchanges this 
exemption for bilateral transactions wont matter much but lets think it 
through  Is EOL or APX an alternative
Massey specifically asked us to address forward markets in our comments  
Specifically has FERC done everything it can to encourage forward market 
development  In addition to any other points we might make I think we 
should argue that PJMing the market wont facilitate and may even hinder 
forward market development  Also we should advocate actions by FERC that 
take away secondguessing by the CPUC in order to reduce utility fears about 
contracting forward
We have to give the Commission a way out on price caps  We need to think 
through whether there is something we can live with here or we should take 
the approach I took in my testimony  FERC should encourage the state to 
provide rate protection for selected customer classes by putting those 
requirements up for bid ie get the utility out of the commodity business as 
much as possible
Finally on governence issues we should argue for a narrowe role for the ISO 
as a way of diffusing the emotional governence debate  Analogy  if the ISO 
is simply the air traffic controller all parties will simply be interested in 
retaining the most technically competent people not hiring or appointing 
their lackies or friends  So long as the ISO has a role in setting prices 
acquiring supplies or running the market it is destined to be controversial 
and highly politicized  Those functions should be left to the market

		 Subject Re Update  Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes

Thanks for your comments Steve  

The legal arguments are one piece of our  point action plan it relates to 
action items  and  that I outlined in my November  email to the 
group  Action item  and I agree this must be our primary focus is to 
communicate to the Alberta Government i Enrons views on what mistakes are 
being made by governments in other jurisdictions in response to high price 
levels  and ii Enrons plans for Alberta if the Alberta Government stays 
the course and does not interfere in the market   We are hopeful this can 
be done through Milnthorp and Delainey meeting with Premier Klein and or 
Minister Cardinal  If such a meeting isnt possible we will simply have to 
get the message through to them via lower level officials in the Alberta 
Government 

On Tuesday Rob Milnthorp left messages for Premier Klein the Premiers Chief 
of Staff and Minister Cardinal and the Cardinals Deputy Minister Ken 
Smith  I also spoke to Larry Charach of the ADRD    The speaking points 
that we prepared to guide us through these calls are as follows

Enron understands that electricity prices in Alberta are an important issue 
for the Government

Enron has concerns with a number of recent rule and market design 
developments in the electricity market 

Enron feel that it would be helpful for the President and CEO of Enron North 
America and Rob M to sit down for a brief meeting with the Premier and 
Minister Cardinal to
 
  Explain Enrons current plans to expand commercial operations in both the 
electricity and natural gas sectors

 Express Enrons concerns that the Alberta electricity market may not 
indeed be open for business given recent developments including   

i The MAP and its adverse effect on the PPA Buyers and the no harm 
commitment

ii Power Pool rule changes of the sort recently proposed will irreparably 
damage existing suppliers such as Enron the ultimate effect of which will 
undoubtedly be the lack of development of much needed new supply and longer 
term high prices for consumers  

 Express Enrons willingness to draw on our experience in other markets and 
explain our vision of how the Government can work through this difficult 
period in the shortest possible time frame

Ken Smith returned Milnthorps call this morning and Rob Milnthorp advised 
that he covered each of the above speaking points and the conversation went 
very well  Smith asked him what would you do if you were us and Rob 
replied that the Government must stay the course as the alternatives will 
make the situation worse  Rob also told Smith that Enrons preference is to 
continue to work with the Government on these difficult issues and Enron 
doesnt like sending letters that threaten legal action to the Government or 
the Power Pool especially since we share a common vision on electricity 
restructuring with the Alberta Government  Smith indicated that with the 
Alberta Legislature back in session it would be difficult to get a meeting 
for us with the Premier but he would try to do so and would get back to 
Milnthorp  

Whether we get a meeting with the Premier or not we still need to prepare a 
new briefing note for the government within the next week and at the very 
least Rob Milnthorp and I can meet with Larry Charach and Ken Smith to walk 
them through this document  As you say our document must focus on the 
adverse effect on consumers and the implications of the Government moving 
off the strategy it continues to publicly support the Premier said again 
this week in question period that the problem is that we are short supply

Subject Re Update  Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes  

congratulations

One thing to add to the arguments  we have to make the adverse effect on 
consumers the centerpiece of our arguments  We need the legal arguments too 
but this is fundamentally a political and consumer protection driven 
discussion  We have to be prepared to demonstrate that the key to Alberta 
reducing prices is allowing new generation to enter and to do that you have 
to allow a true market price to be posted  California has seen the 
cancellation of numerous projects while they remain desparate for new supply 
because they have tried to artificially constrain prices  Thats not good 
for consumers  If they need a lower cost solution for consumers or 
protection from price volatility in the meantime they need to outsource 
the residential supply business in blocks for fixed price bids

Regardless of how we frame the arguments or the solutions however we have 
to make the public policy  consumer protection arguments the center of our 
written and oral presentations

Do you agree

		 Subject Update  Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes

Dale McMaster called this afternoon to advise that the Power Pool Council 
agreed to delay any decision on the recently proposed rule changes importers 
excluded from setting pool price and dispatch risk for a period of two 
weeks  During this two week period Dale has been asked to obtain stakeholder 
input into ways to address concerns about whether the spot price in the 
Alberta Power Pool is a product of interaction among competitiors in a 
efficient market   

In our discussions with the Power Pool and ADRD today and yesterday Enron 
expressed its willingness to work with the Power Pool to provide feedback on 
suggested rule changes but has also made it clear that we do not agree with 
the premise that there is a problem that requires emergency amendments to 
the Pool rules  Our position has been that Alberta is short supply and 
significant changes to the rules and or market design will only discourage 
new generation development 

Dale McMaster had just left the Power Pool Council meeting when he called and 
had not yet put much thought into how to define the issue he has to address 
and what the process will be   We discussed the process and it appears he 
will likely receive comments from stakeholders at large and also assemble a 
small committee of  stakeholders which would include Enron to work with 
the Power Pool to consider possible changes to the Pool rules  Dale said he 
would try to pull together a terms of reference document that would define 
the mandate of the small committee by tomorrow

After my call with Dale McMaster Peter Keohane and I spoke to Aleck Trawick 
and we have asked Blakes to assist us in three areas

 Once the terms of reference of this small committee are released and 
assuming Enron is asked to participate on the committee Blakes will assist 
us with preparing a letter that states that Enrons participation does not 
represent acknowledgement or agreement that the Power Pool Rules must be 
amended to address the concerns of some stakeholders about real time pricing 
in Alberta and that Enrons participation on the committee is on a without 
prejudice basis

 Enron needs to obtain the final memo from Frontier Economics in which 
Frontier provides its opinion on how the proposed rule changes i would 
introduce price discrimination into the Alberta electricity market ii would 
be contrary to the development of an efficient fair and openly competitive 
market for electricity iii would compromise the independence of the Power 
Pool and iv would have the expected effect of artificially depressing the 
real time price of electricity in Alberta  Once Blakes receives a copy of 
the Frontier Economics memo they will prepare a memo for Enron advising i 
whether the two week process of consultation by the Power Pool is in 
accordance with the standards required of the PPC as an administrative 
tribunal operating in Alberta and ii whether such rule changes offend the 
provisions of the EUA

 Blakes will advise Enron of the possible avenues of recourse ie appeal 
to the AEUB and or legal action in the Court of Queens Bench in the event 
the proposed rule changes or similar changes are approved by the PPC at the 
end of this two week period   GPC and Eric Thode will also be consulted on 
this issue and obviously input from all those within Enron working on this 
project will be sought prior to any decision being made to pursue any 
possible legal remedies  

Please advise if you have any comments

Regards

Rob

		 Subject Outline for Project on RealTime Markets

Dear Steve

Once again I call on you for advice Who within Enron should I talk with 
about a new project I am working on related to realtime balancing 
operations and markets all the messy stuff that causes so many problems 
within all the existing ISOs

Here is the outline for the project Can you send me your suggestions on 
revising the outline other people at Enron and elsewhere to contact 
related to these markets and written materials on how the various ISO 
markets operate 

Thanks

Eric

ISSUES TO DISCUSS FOR PROJECT ON
REALTIME BALANCING OPERATIONS AND MARKETS
November  

 Introduction Importance of realtime operations and markets 
Essential for reliability especially security 
Basis for all forward contracts hour and dayahead block monthlies 
bilaterals 
Realtime prices motivate generationcapacity decisions new construction 
repowering retirements 
Ensure equitable treatment for new intermittent and distributed resources 
 Physical Requirements and Operations 
Balance generation to load in nearreal time intrahour 
Normal conditions frequency response CPS CPS 
Contingency conditions DCS 
In neither case is it necessary for generation to exactly balance load over 
short time periods eg  minutes but must balance energy over longer 
intervals 
Benefits of aggregation 
Performance and characteristics of individual generation and load resources 
random fluctuations energy level ramp rate acceleration rate startup 
time minimum run time block loading energylimited characteristics of 
hydro units etc 
Controlarea balance vs individualschedule balance good vs bad inadvertent 
interchange 
NERC and FERC requirements 
 Operations with Vertically Integrated Utilities 
Unit commitment 
Economic dispatch 
Regulation 
Contingency reserves 
Control area forecasts of loads and resources effects of forecasts on unit 
commitment and dispatch 
Treatment of payments and penalties for energy imbalance and inadvertent 
interchange 
 RTO Operations and Markets 
Generation not owned by RTO RTO must purchase outputs from generation and 
load resources 
Relationship between realtime operations and markets how are resources 
dispatched and by whom and how are they compensated 
Time interval    or  minutes for dispatch and price setting what 
are the tradeoffs in choosing among these intervals 
Single marketclearing price in each interval vs payasbid for each resource 
Pay for energy only or pay also for maneuverability eg ramp and 
acceleration rates how do resource constraints determine which resources 
are permitted to set the marketclearing price and which arent and why 
Set prices ex ante or ex post If prices set ex ante what is the basis for 
the value 
Should unit commitment resource scheduling be done by individual suppliers 
by RTO or both 
Relationship between realtime markets and ICAP and RMR requirements and RTO 
requirements to ICAP and RMR units to bid resources into realtime market 
Treatment of exports and imports rules governing interchange scheduling 
number of schedule changes per hour permitted ramp rates for schedule 
changes 
To what extent does the RTO make shortterm forecasts of load and generation 
how far into the future  minutes to  hours how does the RTO use these 
forecasts Should the RTO commit and dispatch resources on the basis of 
expected future conditions ie beyond the current and next interval Who 
pays for these RTO decisions 
Should RTO publish prices and let demand and supply respond to the price 
signal or should RTO dispatch resources up and down based on supplier bids 
If the RTO explicitly dispatches resources should uninstructed deviations be 
treated differently in terms of payment or penalties from instructed 
deviations What about a resources failure to follow instructions 
Under what circumstances should RTO go outofmarket for resources What 
should set the price of payment to these resources 
Under what conditions if any are penalties appropriate for what kinds of 
behavior what determines the magnitude of the penalty Should penalties 
apply to generation only or to loads also 
How if at all should capacity assigned to ancillary services especially 
the reserve services be incorporated into realtime operations and markets 
For example should the capacity assigned to contingency reserves be set 
aside and used only when a major outage occurs Or should such reserves be 
used routinely whenever it is economic to do so as long as sufficient 
capacity is available to meet the NERC reserve requirements 
How should intermittent resources eg wind be treated in realtime 
operations and markets Should they be treated any differently from a large 
volatile load 
Can retail loads participate in realtime markets How 
 Case Studies of US ISOs 
California 
PJM New York and New England

  Conclusions and Recommendations 
Key features of operations and markets 
What works 
What are the options 
What problems still remain

2000-11-17T23:20:00-08:00,"Another key point  to avoid the mistakes of California policy makers must 
make it easy to site and interconnect new generation  In California peak 
demand rose by about  MW from     The market responded with 
porposed capacity additions of about  MW  Most of these facilities are 
working thier way through the tangle of state and local approvals  The 
problems we saw in California did not need to occur if policy makers simply 
enabled the market to work  Also its worth noting that the deregulated 
market did work  Customers who signed with Enron saw a lower bill than 
prederegulation Enron hedged its commitments and so our customers and 
Enron did just fine during the summer  Deregulation worked the problems in 
California can be directly traced to continued regulatory interference in the 
market

Heres my shot  I did it in Revision mode so you can see the changes  Note 
that Enron never got out of the retail market in CA and has gathered about 
 MW of retail load  were bigger than all but two of the municipal 
utilities in the state  Enron stopped marketing to residential consumers  
thats what all the  fuss was about in   Anyone else feel free to take

 Harvey Morris Esq
 California Public Utilities Commission
  Public Utilities Commission
 San Francisco California   

  Re   I  Subpoenas Served on Enron Power Marketing Inc
 EPMI Enron Energy Services Operations Inc and Enron Energy Services
 Inc collectively referred to as EES Enron Energy Marketing
 Corporation EEMC and Portland General Electric Corporation Portland
 Generalcollectively sometimes referred to as the Enron Entities

 Harvey

  I am writing in response to the various voicemail exchanges and
 phone calls between Michael Day on behalf of the Enron Entities and
 yourself during the past few weeks  Here is the current status as we
 understand it  Based upon the agreements we reached between October 
  and October   date of your confirming email the Enron
 Entities have made the following document productions in response to the
 subpoenas served by California Public Utilities Commission the
 Commission

  October    Bate Nos Enron Entities  on behalf
 of all Enron Entities Responsive to Request Nos  

  October   Bate Nos P on behalf of Portland
 General Responsive to Request Nos    and 

  November   Bate No Enron Entities  Diskette with
 EES EEMC retail data Responsive to Request Nos  to    to 
 and 

  November   Bate No P Diskettes with Portland
 General Data which include approximate  wholesale transactions
 Responsive to Request Nos  to   to  and 

 We believe with these productions we have complied with the October
 th agreement with respect to Portland General and EES EEMC  As you
 know these productions were all made reserving the Enron Entities rights
 to object or challenge the subpoenas and reserving any claims defenses
 objections jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses

  We originally had hoped to have all of the Transactional Data for
 EPMI as defined in our October th email available for production by
 October th  However we were also mindful of your expressed expectation
 that any data provided be useful and reliable  The collection of data you
 requested in the subpoenas is neither kept electronically in the same
 location nor organized as you requested it  In fact during our review of
 some of the data we found significant errors that called into question the
 methodology by which the data was extracted from existing information
 When it became apparent that we could not accurately estimate how long it
 would take to get reliable data given the volume of transactions involved
 we informed you of the problem  We now understand that if we cannot give
 you a firm date when the balance of the Transactional Data will be
 available the Commission believes it will have no choice but to seek to
 compel production before the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission
 FERC  We understand the pressure that you must be under to get data
 immediately but we cannot at this time give you another date in the
 immediate future by which we are certain that we will be able to produce
 accurate data

  Moreover during the iterim between October th and today a number
 of significant events have occurred that we believe bear on the subpoenas
 served on the Enron entities  First we understand that many other
 parties who were served with the same subpoenas have not provided the
 detailed information requested and have objected on a variety of very
 sound legal grounds  Second the Commission itself has without a hearing
 on the motion unilaterally revised the proposed protective order that is
 supposed to govern these productions and summarily denied other changes
 sought by other parties served  Third the Commission has filed its
 motion before FERC seeking an order compelling the production of the data
 from those other parties that have objected and seeking an expedited
 hearing and production schedule  We note that the reasons stated in the
 motion before FERC as the basis for the production are materially
 different than the reasons originally stated in the ex parte application
 to the Commissions own Administrative Law Judge who issued the subpoenas
 Finally FERC itself has completed its investigation and has issued a
 tentative order as of November  

  Originally the Enron Entities had been prepared to accept most
 favored nation treatment with respect to protective orders and requests
 by others to limit the scope of the subpoenas and produce information that
 was available  However given both the Commissions stated urgent need
 for an immediate answer that EPMI cannot in good faith give despite
 substantial effort date for production of reliable and accurate
 Transaction Data and the uncertainty created by the above described
 intervening events EPMI believes it has no choice but to serve its formal
 objections and responses to the subpoenas and await the Commissions
 threatened motion to compel before FERC

  We also understand from our discussions with you that the Commission
 has created various lists or categories for the entities that have been
 served with subpoenas  We understand that there is a list for those
 entities that have been cooperating a list for those who have been
 delaying and a list for those who have been objecting and exercising their
 rights to challenge the subpoenas  We understand that the Commission
 intends to punish by whatever means it has available those entities that
 object and exercise their rights to challenge the subpoenas  We deplore
 these tactics but despite all of the efforts to cooperate described
 above we understand that EPMI may in fact be moved from the cooperating
 list to the group to be punished for exercising its rights

  If you have and questions or comments please do not hesitate to
 contact me

         Sincerely

2000-11-19T12:11:00-08:00,"You had asked for my input on a response to a letter you received from Tom 
Donahue regarding increasing Enrons contribution to the US Chamber to 
  I have been giving the Chamber a bit of a hard time lately and 
wanted you to know why

I have been in touch with both Tom and his staff over the last year  Donahue 
has done a very good job raising money and getting his membership rolls up 
both in terms of membership and dollar contribution per member  My 
reservation about the Chamber is that they wont take a stand on something 
which is in the best interests of the vast majority of their membership if it 
will alienate a vocal few  Electric restructuring was a key example of 
this  There was no doubt where they should have been on the issue but 
instead of embracing retail open access legislation at the federal level they 
decided to have a process  Naturally all the utilities volunteered to 
participate in the process and outnumbered the nonutility members when it 
came time to vote  The vote supported wholesale but not retail reform 
with heavy emphasis on ensuring stranded cost recovery  Afterwards the 
federal debate shifted solely to wholesale legislation though this is not 
exclusively the Chambers fault

Unfortunately Toms forceful and competitive approach when it comes to 
raising his membership rolls leaves him unwilling to do the right thing if a 
few members will be upset  For Enron its a bit like paying  for a 
veto right  The only things the organization pushes for are the things 
everyone agrees on in the business community  eg China PNTR and lower 
corporate taxes  things they will push for whether we pay dues or not and 
things we will add our separate voice to in any event  

As I have explained to the Chamber Enron makes its money challenging 
conventional wisdom changing the way markets work and dislocating 
incumbents  Anything important that we stand for is likely to alienate some 
members of the business community and the Chamber is unlikely to stand with 
us  They represent the status quo in the business community  Tom is an 
extremely promising leader he needs to create a new kind of voice for the 
business community  A voice which stands for moving business to the next 
level not just protecting its current position

Having said all that the Chamber particularly its international chapters 
has been useful to us in the past  In previous years Donahue himself has 
intervened on our behalf with Latin American leaders  As a consequence I 
have asked them for a proposal which would allow us to remain Chamber members 
at a lower dues and policy participation level but with continuing access 
to their international activities  I suggested something in the  
range  Thats why they are approaching you they want us to double our 
current dues to 

Currently I am inclined to just withdraw from Chamber membership but I plan 
to defer to Linda Robertson  I am interested in your insights or if you 
prefer you can simply refer them to Linda or me"
2000-11-20T02:12:00-08:00,"Please provide me an update on the progress of the working group you have led 
this year  There are several things I would like you to cover in this regard

Did the working group function through the year or was it terminated I 
recognize there may be good reasons for the latter but would like to 
understand those reasons

What did the group accomplish

Would you recommend continuing it   Any changes

Are there other topics we should consider for working groups in the future  
Any changes to the working group process itself

Please provide input on the individuals you worked with  You should be able 
to do this through the PEP system  If you cannot please provide the 
feedback by confidential email to me  Because the PRC is coming up soon 
please provide the feedback by December  "

Subject Update  Proposed Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes

Rick

You will recall Steve Kean participated in a conference call on Nov  with 
John Lavorato et al to discuss emergency Pool Rule changes that the Power 
Pool intended to implement in two days  We developed a  point action plan 
to deal with the proposed Power Pool rule changes that would have a 
significant impact on the value of Enrons PPA investment in Alberta    
By way of update to Steve you may wish to brief him that  It appears the 
Power Pool will not proceed with the rule change designed to exclude 
importers from setting pool price  They will proceed with dispatch risk rule 
changes but we have given input on those too and I am optimistic that Enron 
will be able to live with these rule changes the final wording of which we 
should see on Monday  We  have set up a meeting with the Minister of 
Resource Development you Rob Milnthorp and I will attend on December  to 
encourage the Alberta Government to stay the course and  This week we will 
finalize our Lessons from other Jurisdictions document that Steve sent me 
materials to include in and will provide it to the Alberta Government and 
Power Pool and then follow up with them

Subject Update  Proposed Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes

The attached memo provides an update on the status of the Power Pools 
further consideration of the proposed rule changes  In summary it appears 
the Pool will not proceed with the proposal to exclude import offers from 
setting pool price but will recommend a rule that reduces ability of 
suppliers to become price takers on volumes that were originally priced too 
high to clear the merit order  I will receive more specifics on the dispatch 
risk rule change on Monday

Regards

Rob

 Montreal November  

 RE  North American Commission for Environmental Cooperation Electricity 
Advisory Board  Message from Chair

 Dear Colleagues

 I wanted to take this opportunity to update you on a few important planning 
and communication matters regarding your participation on the North American 
Commission for Environmental Cooperations NACEC Electricity Advisory Board 
and to provide you with the date for the upcoming meeting It will take place 
the th of January at the Commissions offices in Montreal

 In August I had the opportunity to visit the NACECs Montreal headquarters 
to discuss a number of the key issues to be addressed by the electricity 
restructuring expert report and to get a better feel for the nature of the 
guidance and input the Advisory Board can contribute to this initiative  
More than ever I am convinced that the outstanding group of individuals 
serving on the Advisory Board can play an important role in defining and 
deepening our understanding of the key trade and environment issues at play 
on a continental scale

 The Secretariat has made considerable progress in conducting a thorough 
scoping analysis compiling a searchable database of renewable energy 
definitions and portfolio standards and initiating work in the area of market 
access and trade disciplines  At this early stage of development of the 
expert report I believe it is an ideal time to schedule our first meeting of 
the Advisory Board to familiarize ourselves with major issues and provide 
advice on the scope and content of the report as well as the broader 
initiative

 The Secretariat has been in contact with you in advance to select a date 
for our first meeting so that the greatest number of Board members can 
participate Accordingly we will hold a oneday meeting in Montreal on 
Tuesday the th of January  The NACEC will cover all travel expenses 
along with accommodations and per diem The Meeting Coordinator at the NACEC 
Leticia Villeneuve will be in touch to assist you in making your travel 
arrangements If you wish you may contact her at  Those Board 
members that cannot attend will be able to join portions of the meeting by 
conference call

 I have included a draft agenda for your review along with the list of 
current members of the Advisory Board  The Secretariat will soon establish a 
web site and list serve to facilitate our communications including the 
exchange and review of documents The Secretariat will also prepare in 
advance of our first meeting a brief but detailed report outline including 
the major themes that are being considered for the report  The Secretariat 
is seeking our views on the key issues that warrant special analysis

 I very much look forward to meeting you soon in Montreal  As always feel 
free to contact me if you would like to talk over any aspect of our work 
together Or if you have any questions regarding the logistics of the 
meeting please contact Alicia Chica at the Secretariat at  or 
by email at  

 Sincerely

 Philip Sharp

2000-11-26T01:54:00-08:00,"I had a hard time logging on remotely so I just got this now  As you can 
see its a relatively brief overview presentation for Jeff not going into 
much of the detail surrounding for example performance criteria and 
evaluation or job classification where much of the real work remains  The 
main purpose of this presentation is to give Jeff something for the December 
Board meeting

I need your thoughts on something one of the rationales I had discussed with 
McKinsey for this new organizational approach was the need to win the war for 
talent  A partnership at least theoretically creates unlimited opportunity 
and reduced hierarchy in an organization  It also creates substantial upside 
opportunity and continued motivation for the business leadership  My 
question for you and your team is where are we at risk in fact when it comes 
to attracting and retaining talent  My suspicion is that our turnover is 
farily low and that it is especially low in the top tiers of the 
organization  Where we run into problems my gut tells me is that we have 
some difficulty getting the very best from the very best schools ie we often 
lose out to the IBanks and perhaps McKinseylevel consulting firms and 
that we have a tough time holding the most talented managers and directors 
ie were OK at the top livels already  Could you have someone do an 
analysis of the turnover rates at different levels  We may need to weed out 
the performance related departures including those who left after getting a 
low performance ranking even if they were not officially terminated for 
performance reasons if possible

presentation   I think we also need to have a set of slides or some talking 
points for Jeff that make a compelling case for these changes  Some of the 
points are touched on but I think we have to make a better case for change in 
addition to outlining the changes  Some of the themes which we should 
develop further might focus on the challenges we face in sustaining our 
growth this was a major theme at this years management conference  
Terrie please forrward a copy of Gary Hamels presentation to the addressees 
on this email  These challenges imply the solutions we are proposing a 
professional partnership model which provides opportunity and compensation 
incentives to attract and retain top talent and encourage cooperation across 
the company capturing and exploiting knowledge within the organization and 
a more formalized approach to business building through an accelerator

Subject Duke Energy proposes to manage SDGEs entire electricity load for 
five years


The note below was sent to the  or so reporters that I have been working
with on the CA electricity crisis

FYI

Below is a press release we distributed today that details a proposal we
have made to San Diego Gas  Electric to manage their entire electricity
load up to  megawatts for five years at a fixed price of  a
megawatt hour  The proposal was detailed in our comments to the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission on their recent proposed solutions to
Caifornia

As the release indicates forward contracting for electricity is a very
effective way for the states utilities to manage the volitility in the
states electricity markets  With natural gas prices more than doubling
since last year and last week being up to seven times higher than last year
on the spot market up to  a million BTU vs an average of about 
in  we feel that its imperative for utilities to take advantage of
these contracts so they can manage their own risk  exposure and their
customers risk exposue to this volitility and the associated high prices
The price of natural gas represents about  percent of our plants
operating costs

We signed a forward power contract with PGE Oct  and Southern Cal
Edison Nov  announced for the first time in the this release  The
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission strongly encourages these kind of
contracts  and we hope that we or other wholesale power marketers can
do more of this kind of business with these utilities and SDGE in the very
near future to bring stability to the states wholesale electricity market

Our proposal is detailed on pages eight and nine in the FERC filing which
also includes our other positions on the California electricity crisis
These are also detailed on our CA web site at
wwwDukeEnergycom California

For more information call me at  or page me at

		 Subject Alberta Pool Rule Changes

Unfortunately today in an unprecedented move the Alberta Government 
overruled the Power Pool on its decision yesterday not to amend the Power 
Pool Rules and exclude importers from setting pool price  The Minister 
signed a regulation under the Electric Utilities Act that excludes imports 
from influencing the determination of the pool price   The Power Pool has 
been tasked to work out the mechanics of implementing the regulation  Larry 
Charach advised that this move was made by the politicians in the face of 
advice not to do it from Larry   Apparently the Premier met with 
representatives of Alberta farmers yesterday and also learned of what the 
Government considers to be excessive pricing being offered by  Enmax the 
City of Calgary owned retailer that included  Year onpeak  Mwh Cdn 
 Year allhours  Mwh Cdn   

Peter Keohane and I have a meeting tomorrow morning with lawyers from 
Blakes  The present thinking is that we need to get legal advice on whether 
we need to   send a letter to the Government indicating that Enron believes 
this action to be contrary to the provisions of the EUA prior to our 
participating in the MAP Auction on Monday and Tuesday  The fear is that our 
conduct of pursuing new commercial opportunities in this market may somehow 
estop us from later arguing the new regulation is ultra vires the EUA   
Notwithstanding the advice we get on this point there is agreement here 
Milnthorp and Keohane that if we do send a letter it must not include a 
paragraph threatening to sue the Alberta Government

Either I was dealing with state and federal regulatory agencies in the US 
working on political campaigns in Florida and Texas or negotiating with 
international governments preparing for purchase of utility concessions  All 
while developing strategy building and organizing teams to execute the work 
and seeing to it that the job got done

Three documents are attached  I suggest this order to read them 
 JPO Res Addendum gives you a view looking forward where Ill go what I 
can do as all resumes should
 JPO Res Exec Summ gives you a view looking back where Ive been what 
Ive done as all resumes would
 JPO Res Full CV gives detail on specific assignments and projects 
essentially an expanded version of 


Hope the holidays are joyous and safe for all

Mark  you must read this  Very funny

from one of my limey friends




 NOTICE OF REVOCATION OF INDEPENDENCE
 To the citizens of the United States of America
 In the light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to
 govern yourselves we hereby give notice of the revocation of your
 independence effective today
 Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchical duties
 over all states commonwealths and other territories  Except Utah which
 she does not fancy  Your new prime minister The rt hon Tony Blair MP
 for the  of you who have until now been unaware that there is a
 world outside your borders will appoint a minister for America without
 the need for further elections  Congress and the Senate will be
 disbanded  A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine
 whether any of you noticed
 To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency the following
 rules are introduced with immediate effect
  You should look up revocation in the Oxford English Dictionary
 Then look up aluminium  Check the pronunciation guide  You will be
 amazed at just how wrong you have been pronouncing it  Generally you
 should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels  Look up vocabulary
 Using the same twenty seven words  interspersed with filler noises such as
 like and you know is an unacceptable and inefficient form of
 communication  Look up interspersed
  There is no such thing as US English  We will let Microsoft know
 on your behalf
  You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents
 It
 really isnt that hard

  Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as
 the good guys
  You should relearn your original national anthem God Save The
 Queen but only after fully carrying out task   We would not want you
 to get confused and give up half way through
  You should stop playing American football  There is only one kind
 of football  What you refer to as American football is not a very good
 game
 The  of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders
 may have noticed that no one else plays  American football  You will no
 longer be allowed to play it and should instead play proper football
 Initially it would be best if you played with the girls  It is a
 difficult game  Those of you brave enough will in time be allowed to
 play rugby which is similar to American football but does not involve
 stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body
 armour like nancies  We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby
 sevens side by 
  You should declare war on Quebec and France using nuclear weapons
 if they give you any merde  The  of you who were not aware that
 there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky  The
 Russians have never been the bad guys  Merde is French for sht
  July th is no longer a public holiday  November th will be a new
 national holiday but only in England  It will be called Indecisive
 Day
  All American cars are hereby banned  They are crap and it is for
 your own good  When we show you German cars you will understand what we
 mean
  Please tell us who killed JFK  Its been driving us crazy

I have reviewed the most recent IM and dont have any significant comments 
but my review did highlight the need to have a set or sets of 
eyesinternally who understand the regulatory overlay of the Southern Cone 
better and who are also in a better position   physically and with language 
skills  to assess the  nature of the regulatory approvals needed and to 
effectively pull on a set of local resources when this project begins to take 
shape With all of that in mind I would recommend we  at the very least 
bring Jose into the loop I intend to stay actively engaged and do whatever I 
can but we need help immediately on the regulatory front  the last thing I 
would want to have happen to the project would be have it held hostage at the 
governmental approval stage  being proactive now by bringing Jose over the 
wall would be my strong recommendationPlease advise

Extension 

Attention MR  STEVE  KEAN
  MS  CINDY  OLSON     

Dear Mr Kean and Ms Olson

I am privileged and delighted for providing me with this opportunity of 
writing directly to both of you while I am on redeployment status

The purpose of this letter is to respectfully appeal to both of you to please 
help me continue serving Enron and continue being an active manager within 
this most challenging environment as I feel I am most qualified

I joined Enron EECC on March   now am an EES employee I am a 
Mechanical Engineer with  years work experience and extraordinary track 
record in the oil  gas and power generation EPC business worldwide with 
major global organizations  

I hold a PhD in Mechanical Engineering specifically in the Gas Turbines 
Technology I have been a Project Manager Senior Project Manager and 
Project Director on major multimillion Dollar onshore and offshore 
development projects since  in every hydrocarbons  producing region

I was interviewed at Enrons EECC in mid February  pursuant to my 
application for Project Manager Senior Project Manager position  

I was then hired on March   as Project Engineering Manager PEM under 
quite urgent circumstances to be in charge of all three  major and most 
active Power Projects at EECC in Brazil  Just one  week later after my 
new hires orientation I had to join a delegation and travel to Brazil for 
Due Diligence of Local Engineering and Construction Contractors  

The Expected NTP was January  and the life of these foreign Projects 
except for Electrobolt  simple cycle plant is three  to four  years 
ie until the year  and   These Projects are RioGen Cuiaba II and 
Electrobolt

I was attracted to Enron due to its standing and recognition in the industry 
reputation globalization and active market penetration  In fact I felt 
very fortunate to become the center of the abovementioned challenges with 
three such major Enron Power Projects

I resigned my then current and very secure position as Senior Project Manager 
at Solar Turbines Incorporated a Caterpillar company after almost  
successful years where I was entrusted with Solars major turnkey power and 
gas compression projects worldwide 

My prime objective and priority then when I accepted to work for Enron were 
clearly to tackle and continue with the new challenges that Enron offered me 
until the year     

However I am still very optimistic and hopeful that with your kind support 
I am hoping to receive due consideration of this appeal

I have already interviewed with Messrs Steve Meyers and Dave Roberts at EES 
and both believe that they are certainly in need of a strong technical person 
like myself but no confirmation has been received yet

I have also applied to at least fifteen  pertinent positions within EES 
ENA and Enron Transportation but unfortunately have received no response 
yet

Nevertheless I am most certain that you do not want to loose a knowledgeable 
and active member of your team and I am most confident that you can assist 
placing me in a position where I can contribute most positively to Enrons 
continued success and profitability

Sincerely

Adel

		 Subject Re Options the Governors Considering

Jeff Dasovich and I along with several IEP members met with Gov Davis 
staff today including his Chief of Staff his Staff Director and two policy 
advisors on energy issues  They made the following points

The Governor is personally spending a great deal of time on electricity 
issues and is forcing them to spend their time on it as well
The Governor recognizes that part of the problem is a supply shortage but 
they put special emphasis on the view that in addition to supply shortfalls 
a big part of the problem is a dysfunctional market  a thinly veiled 
reference to price manipulation by people sitting in the room
The Governors view is that all participants regulators utilities 
customers and generators must behave responsibly
Everyone must share the pain
The legislative battles are likely to start as soon as the legislature 
returns next week and the Governor will be putting forth several legislative 
proposals in the next couple of weeks
While staff went out of its way to say that the list of proposals in the 
attached email were unofficial and for discussion purposes only it was 
fairly clear that they defined much of what the governor plans to propose

The meeting was not very encouraging nor did it provide much in the way of 
new information  The IEP group was on message making the usual arguments 
about the need for forward contracting expedited generation and transmission 
siting a real retail market to promote demand side responses etc  The 
staff is clearly focussed on forward contracting as part of the solution but 
remains committed to the idea that generators have to cough up some money and 
remain subject to rate caps possible restrictions on sales outside the state 
at least at peak times etc  One approach they appear to be toying with is 
a share the pain proposal which would have utilities absorbing some of the 
deferred costs and consumers absorbing some of the deferred costs in the form 
of higher rates  That leaves generators  who they might want to either 
agree to some refunds or provide power at lower goingforward prices

The staff says that they remain open to proposed solutions but the Davis 
administration appears unwilling to spend any political capital to fix the 
problem  

I think we are in for a lengthy legislative and PUC fight  We should as 
always provide consistent and reasonable solutions  I think we should 
prepare a document for distribution to staff legislators and anyone else 
that takes the factual background and proposed solutions we have put forward 
eg in Beldens presentation and the Seabron Adamson whitepaper and wraps 
them in a more political context  In other words we have already 
articulated the right answers we now need to put a political rationale 
around our proposals  a set of arguments which responds directly to the 
political opposition those answers are likely to encounter  Jeff will follow 
up with one of the staff members in particular Kari Dohn and I would 
suggest that Jeff and Sandi work together on putting the necessary political 
rhetoric around the solutions we have proposed

Several IEP companies have been invited to a meeting with the Governors 
staff next Monday November th
The following are some options which the Governors office is considering  
IEP is doing some preliminary research on some of these topics  IEP would 
like to arrange a teleconference call around noon on Monday November th to 
discuss the Governors meeting  Please advise us as to whether your have 
been invited and who you are sending
Californias electricity supply situation has two interrelated problems  
 high wholesale electricity costs and  marginally adequate supply of 
generation  both have combined to create a dysfunctional wholesale 
electricity market  The goals should be
 To assure reliable electricity to California consumers for the lowest 
reasonable cost
o Consider requiring that all instate generation be sold in state
o Consider reasserting state authority over the operation maintenance and 
safety practices of all instate generating facilities for public health and 
safety purposes
o Consider developing a state power authority to build generation and 
own operate transmission
o Consider requiring utilities both to retain existing and to build new 
generation
o Consider providing utilities with authority to stabilize retail prices to 
be paid by consumers through development of an energy portfolio that reduces 
exposure to spot markets including contracting forward for much more of 
their unmet power needs
o Consider extending consumer rate freeze
o Consider centralizing power plant dispatch like the other ISOs in the rest 
of the country
o Consider eliminating the ISO and assigning its functions to either a state 
or private entity that can acquire the transmission facilities and control 
the electricity transmission grid MUNIs have proposed this
o Consider sponsoring supporting legislation to change the ISO and PX boards 
to increase accountability
o Expand energy conservation programs focused both on immediate peak demand 
reduction and on longer term broaderbased programs
o Aggressively work to site new generation and transmission facilities to 
streamline permitting and to develop renewable resources
o Call for sponsor federal FERC reform legislation that would
o Impose a regional price cap that varies by time of day and year
o Set requirements for FERC to use its retroactive refund authority
o Improve FERC enforcement over price gouging practices
o Affirm the role of states to protect their customers from unjust prices
o Pressure the FERC to do its job to  bring about responsible seller 
behavior in wholesale electric markets through price controls and other 
market interventions as necessary and  provide refunds to affected 
consumers

Thanks you got it about right except that Keans Democratic
credentials are seriously in question these days as are his  liberal

approach in taking on the monopoly utilities in the battle over electricity
deregulation do you know anyone in the clinton administration who has been

so i apologizebeing in a hurry is no excuse for being careless

heres the silver linings

 gma seems to have gotten it some other way later in the day so from
there point of view they arent focused on where it came from
 there is literally no one at abc who knows i know you
 i give you my word that i will never be at all careless with anything
from you again and wont let even one person have access to

from you or jb for that matter since i had already taken her name and

Following discussions with Steve and Kevin yesterday were providing some 
options for the conduct of final PRC reviews  for the Enron VPs and MDs  
Please let us know which of these options or a derivative therein youd 
prefer  

For continuity through the yearend process we might consider having the 
existing MD VP PRC Committee review the VP slate and  the former EC and two 
newly appointed EC members  who are also VP PRC Committee John  Lavorato 
and Jeff Shankman were suggested ratify the VP slate and review the 
MDs    The newly appointed EC members who are MD level will remain in the 
Not Rated category so that Jeff and John may participate in the overall 
discussion and depart before discussions relative to them and their EC 
colleagues      

Alternatively we might disband the existing MD VP PRC Committee in favor of 
having the newly appointed EC    of whom are MD VP PRC review the VP 
slate  Thereafter the Enron Corporate Policy Committee would be responsible 
for ratifying these results and for reviewing the MDs slate  Insofar as the 
Policy Committee might require further  information on individual MDs 
selected EC members could be invited for an appropriate period of time to 
provide the necessary details   

If we opt to disband the existing MD VP PRC wed need to notify those members 
who arent part of the new EC that their services are no longer required  In 
so much as some of these people are currently assigned to and attending BU 
and functional prerankings clearly the sooner we are able to do this the 
better

Your immediate attention to this issue would be greatly appreciated since we 
are eager to begin the yearend VP MD PRC planning process  Thanks in 
advance

Market based rate applications for transmissionowning utilities merit the 
same level of scrutiny as that given to merger applications ie a 
competitive screening analysis followed by a more detailed behavioral

Steve the purpose of this note is to get your sign off on attending a

evening Timing for approval is at issue

We have been invited by Mr Kamei a senior political figure in the LDP to 
attend a cocktail party this evening The price is Y about  per 
head and we were proposing to send two people My rough estimate is that half 
of each ticket would go to the LDP ie a total of  We have been 
developing a good relationship with the LDP through Kamei and most recently 
he assisted us in arranging a meeting for Ken Lay with the MITI minister 
Accordingly the purpose of attending is to maintain good relations with the 
Japanese Government with a view assisting to further Enron Japans business 
interests in Japan It would be viewed negatively if we were not to attend  

We have external legal counsel signoff that this type of function is legal 
in Japan The function also has the support of Joe Hirl I am aware that 
there is a procedure for political donations however given the number of 
Enron hands that the application needs to pass through we will not have 
approval in time for this evening Hence this note

Through the course of today I will seek to get the application approved 
through Mark Schroeder and John Sherriff and on its way to  Elizabeth 
Labanowski and then to you As mentioned Elizabeth is unlikely to get the 
application until after the function this evening In the meantime I would 
be grateful if you read this email this evening if I could have your

Dave left  He also worked for John Palmisano who also has left the 
company  He ended up in a structuring group working for Brad Richter  Its 
hard to sort out what happened there but perhaps because of LaRences lack of 
interest in the area which he apparently expressed to Brad he has not done 
much structuring work and Brad is not inclined to promote him or keep him in 
the organization  He has been told that he needs to find something now

Could you guys look into this  Perhaps we could either extend his deadline

       Power sector restructuring international activity June  November
       


      This  mailing is a periodic update of the status of international
      electric power sector privatization and restructuring


      Privatizations and restructuring activity continue apace
      Governments faced with burgeoning power demands but lacking the
      funds to meet them are nearly universally opening their generation
      markets to foreign investors even where privatization is not on the
      agenda  More and more stateowned utilities are unbundling
      Competition is being introduced into national markets at both the
      wholesale and retail levels  A few international players have scaled
      back their international investments and shifted substantial portions
      of their portfolio to less risky markets such as the US or Europe
      Competition in Europe has been spurred by the EU Directive  As Asian
      economies recover most governments are starting to move forward
      again with unbundling   restructuring plans  After a year in which
      currency devaluations caused a number of early investors to exit
      Latin America a healthier economy has allowed privatizations to
      restart but at a slower pace


      This mailing summarizes recent developments in Europe AsiaPacific
      Latin America and the Middle East   Africa Maps that summarize the
      status of restructuring in Europe Asia Latin America and Africa
      and the Middle East are attached as Exhibits   A slippery slope
      is Exhibit   Timelines showing the opening of markets in various
      countries by region are in Exhibits

      February  marked the opening of the market to choice for most
      large EU customers who use over  GWh a year  This accounts for
      about a fourth of demand  As of EDay neither France nor Italy
      had passed their proposed enabling legislation  While the EU
      intended for the transmission operator to be independent EDF intends
      to retain control over the grid as will ENEL  A phased deregulation
      of the gas industry began to unfold in similar fashion beginning in
      August 


      Mergers alliances and consolidation are a dominant theme as
      companies jockey for position in the new European power market
      There is a tremendous opportunity for international players to cross
      borders as suppliers of new generation as purchasers of assets
      being spun off by liberalization decrees Italy or because of market
      concentration rulings in mergers Germany Spain Several
      international companies have opened trading offices in Europe or  
      Enron Reliant Southern TXU  HoustonStreetcom launched a
      European online wholesale energytrading platform


             Austria  Austrias liberalizing market is facing problems
              from within and without  The EU is dissatisfied with its
              lack of GTD unbundling although accounts were formally
              separated in   There is no ISO  Internally there is
              intense discussion about an accelerated market opening
              customers over  GWh now have choice Regional utilities
              are angry over the Verbunds proposal to open  of the
              market in late  The Verbund a  SOU is the largest
              generator and owns the transmission grid However it has no
              retail customers and hence is strongly exposed to already
              deregulated wholesale customers CB White Judith Lezaun

             Denmark The  liberalization law exceeds the EU
              directives goals and establishes full retail access by 
              Choice was phased in for large industrials using more than
               GWh in   the threshold dropped in April  more
              than  GWh the next threshold drops to GWh at the end of
               The new law includes unbundling of distribution
              activity and regulated TPA Denmark has recently experienced
              a consolidation wave in generation that leaves the sector
              with  large incumbents The trend is moving downstream into
              distribution and supply Western Denmark is already part of
              the Nordic power exchange NordPool and East Denmark is due to
              join by the end of  Energy policy aims at twenty percent
              of electricity sales would come from renewables by the end of
               up from a current  Cecilia Bergman

             Finland Finland has been fully open to choice since
              September  when a metering requirement was dropped
              Prices immediately dropped but only about  of households
              have switched supplier Finland forms part of the Nordic
              power exchange NordPool The regulator monitors distribution
              tariffs and a rTPA regime is in place In November  the
              Finnish government launched an IPO for  of Fortum the
              holding company for the merger of utility Imatran Voima Oy
              and oil and gas company Neste Oy The Finnish government
              expects to lower its ownership further The largest new
              entrant in the market is Swedish Vattenfall with its
              acquisitions of distributors and some generation capacity
              Further MA in the distribution and supply sector is
              expected Cecilia Bergman

             France There was irony in Frances push for liberalization
              as it assumed its sixmonth EU presidency    France passed
              its electricity law last February a year after required by
              EU directive but had odd implementation decrees stalled
              in the National Assembly  However EDF which still controls
              more than  of French generation realized Brussels would
              hinder its foreign ambitions if its domestic market remained
              closed It recently convinced French authorities to open up
               of the market by the end of  instead of 
              lowering the eligibility threshold to  GWh year from 
              GWh EDF is also aware that its monopoly prevents it from
              easily entering the energy services market   leading EDF to
              promote a relatively rapid total opening of the French
              market Corinne Aigroz White

              Germany  While the Electricity Law was officially effective
              in April  real competition is still impeded by
              complicated TPA grid access conditions especially on the
              retail market A group of new entrants has organized to call
              for a governmental regulator  Some recent studies have shown
              the cost of electricity so low on some bills as to indicate a
              massive crosssubsidization between network operations and
              marketing Recent charges have been made of obstacles to
              competition by a mulitiplicity of fees including customer
              switching charges and supplier entrants registration levies
              In the last  months MA among big national and
              international utilities has redrawn the German utility
              landscape EDF bought a share in EnBW Veba   Viag merged to
              form EON and RWE VEW merged into RWE Furthermore RWE and
              EON must sell their stakes in VEAG due to antitrust
              authority  Currently several utilities are and battling for
              control of East German VEAG whose transmission connections
              make it a portal to Eastern Europe  Judith Lezaun White

             Greece According to the FT Greece has hired a consultant
              us to produce a year plan for state utility PPC  PPC is
              preparing an IPO for  of the company theoretically set
              for  but likely later  Greece has been given until 
              by the EU to conform to the Directive An IEA report
              suggested two major swift changes to the energy sector
              structure  First the government should create a clearer
              separation between itself and the stateowned PPC including
              a separate regulatory agency  Second the government should
              consider splitting the PPC into competing generators to
              maximize competition as well as improving market access
              conditions for IPPs and cogenerators  As the countrys
              largest employer PPC is not likely to effect these changes

              liberalisation in   No date for midmarket and full
              retail opening has been set   Incumbent ESB plans to split
              off its transmission business which will remain stateowned
              Competition in generation will be introduced in  with the
              auctioning of ESB capacity which is intended to create at
              least two new players  Independent power production has been
              allowed for two years now Ben Joyce

             Italy  Italy approved its market deregulation decree in
              March  in some measures it goes beyond the EU Directive

              companies had been sold to foreign energy groups
              Competition for large industrial users began in August

              The Amsterdam Power Exchange modeled along Scandinavian

              trade power over the Internet on an hourly basis for the next
              day  In April  it added dayahead prices at border
              points for Germany although it is not yet much used if
              successful Belgium would follow In October  the

      According to the InterAmerican Development Bank privatization of
      electricity distribution and generation has been accomplished in all
      of the major Latin American economies with the exceptions of
      Venezuela and Mexico  It estimates that  million Latin Americans
      are still not connected to the grid in rural areas of poorer
      countries such as Peru Bolivia and some Central American countries
      Many of the countries that have not already implemented reforms are
      beginning to propose regulatory structures that would open markets to
      investments  And for those who were already open a new development
      is the increasing number of transmission systems being offered either
      as concessions to build or as full privatizations  A big factor
      impacting generation this year has been the regions heavy reliance

              Spain controversial takeover of Enersis Chile will be the
              basis for its diversification into telecom via its
              subsidiaries Enersis and Chilectra  Partially in response to
              Endesas vertical dominance partially in response to supply
              conditions engendered by prolonged drought and partially to
              increase competition Chile has proposed new regulation plans
              which will open the distribution market and reduce node
              unregulated prices from MW to  MW  Until now
              transmission charges have been based on existing operating
              costs Under the proposed reform they would be calculated on
              the operational costs of an optimum network The reforms also
              intended to remove control of the grid operation from the
              generators  The proposed changes likely account for Hydro
              Quebecs being the sole bidder among those prequalified for
              the  sale of Transelec in September
               marked a serious recession and drought seriously

              more  The government claims to be reassessing the rules
              but the reality is that the assets would not receive any
              decent offer now  For now   million new shares
               of capital in ISA will be sold to the public at a

      African and Middle Eastern governments are increasingly opening their
      power sectors to foreign investment although most have not moved
      beyond allowing IPPs  Many GulfStates IPPs are for water and

Thanks for your note  Its a common misconception that we will be mostly 
working on asset disposition  Our focus will be on the efficient operation 
of the assets cleaning up problems finishing projects etc  The sales 
efforts will be conducted through Cliff Baxters group with support from us  
So I dont believe that  I will need the type of effort that you believe 
David can provide and I have no other need for him at this juncture  Cliff 
may feel that he has the need for David  By the way my experience with 
David when he worked for APAChi was that he had not learned much about the 
business and therefore was not terribly helpful to us as we were 
restructuring the group or when we were in a build mode in Thailand

regarding what your requirements might be would be helpful  My understanding

		 Subject white house writers group proposal


Dear Steve

I have given some thought to the ideas you and I discussed regarding a 
website to promote a lighthearted view of some of the more absurd activities 
of the antideregulation and monopoly forces in the electricity battle

I think my White House Writers Group colleague Michael Long would love to 
take this on  He has an eclectic background he spent considerable time as a 
standup comedian then did a tour as the speechwriter for Tennessee senator 
Fred Thompson  He recently had a terrific piece in the Weekly Standard 
taking the air out of Herblock the Washington Post editorial cartoonist

His bio is on our website 
http  wwwwhwgcom Firm WritersBiocfmStaffId   

Mike has excellent instincts for and knowledge of free market ideas and has 
expressed them quite effectively for a number of our clients including 
highprofile CEOs and a couple of presidential candidates  I believe he 
could very quickly get up to speed on your issues and produce the kind of 
humorous stuff you have in mind  I would work closely with him to make sure 
we were getting the issues right

I propose that we begin the effort by letting Michael loose on the 
material  He could get familiar with the ongoing issues in California and 
elsewhere then come up with some preliminary material including a few 
suggestions of how we should format it for a website

If you think he has the hang of it we could have a longer discussion about 
how to create a permanent website and let Michael regularly write and update 
the material  

December is typically a slow month for us and it would be a good time to give 
this a try  Let me know what you think  Id be happy to set up a call with 
the three of us

I enjoyed finally meeting you face to face at Enron and hope we can continue 
to work together

Best

Daniel

suffer from the same problems as electric markets  they are not open

		 Subject Re Draft Talking points about California Gas market




Leslie  Looks good  Just a couple of comments

 General
May want to point out that the roots of Californias current gas woes are the 
same ones causing the electric problemcombined effect of Californias 
importbased energy policy and the states failure to invest in instate 
infrastructure  California imports about  of its electricity but about 
 percent of its gas supply  California has failed to invest in the 
instate infrastructure necessary to support increased gas demand over the 
last decade  So weve got an interstate pipeline superhighway to the border 
and a dirt road of instate transportation once you get into California
The last bullet seems to suggest that manipulation may be taking place  Can 
we support that suggestion and is it one that we want to make necessarily  
If we do suggest that manipulation may in part explain current prices do we 
need to propose ways to eliminate it  Otherwise seems that we may be giving 
FERC ammunition to take action without trying to steer that action in the 
right direction  Maybe Im reading too much into the bullet

 Specific
Competition for gas coming to California has increased significantly  The 
midwest via Alliance is competing away Canadian gas  The Southwest 
Nevada Arizona is competing away supply from the Southwest before it hits 
the California border

I appreciated Margarets update here but I was looking for a bit more  
Specifically I think we should determine a fair market value for the PR we 
received from the event overall and I would like to transfer pay that amount 
from Corp to EBS  I know that sounds a little agressive but if you think 
about it the analysts are very focused on EBSs streaming revenue which has 
been tough to come by  Also it really is a net zero dollar amount to Enron 
at the end of the day but hopefully value creating to the stock price  Hope 
this is not a problem

Hello Kevin

David Tagliarino mentioned that you were interested in capturing the overall 
exposure we received through the Wimbledon deal I have summarized the main 
visibility we received  There were several more freebies in the end but 
they are not accounted for in the following

We had a total of  thirtysecond commercials that ran on NBC and TNT the 
Turner Network We also had  billboards which said This portion of 
Wimbledon was brought to you by Enron a leading energy and broadband 
services company The broadcaster who announced the match also gave us plugs 
by saying Watch this on the net at wwwwimbledonnet streamed by Enron 
There was a banner floating across the bottom of the page saying that as well

Additionally we received ad time and billboards on ESPN CNNsi and several 
other networks  We had banners streaming on up to  websites including 
wwwmsnbccom wwwcnnsicom and wwwwimbledonnet  There was also a static 
banner on the Wimbledon Channel no matter which site you watched it on 
Wimbledon CNNsi or MSNBC  All the banners took you to a jump page we 
created located at wwwenronnet wimbledon 

At Wimbledon we had  courtside seats and  grounds passes  I was also 
told that we had a small paid contract with FastTVcom to stream the archived 
site We released a press release on our services with IBM IMG TWII and 
Wimbledon several days into the event and EBS sent out an email to top 
clients potential clients directing them to the site  Business Week is also 
releasing a profile on Enron in their upcoming eBiz section which features 
the Wimbledon Club as a customer 


Please let me know if you have any questions I can answer

Subject CI at EBS

Steve I have heard through the grapevine that Amy Oberg has relayed to you 
that EBS will not be doing competitive intelligence and that you were 
dismayed to hear this  

Amy is correct in the fact that EBS is not likely to buy the software 
Strategy that provides a strategic topdown focus on competitive 
intelligence    However  EBS is doing tactical competitive analysis and 
market research  We are providing the business units with the information 
that they need to make intelligent decisions at the business unit level 

Amys view is that competitive intelligence CI belongs at the corporate 
level and that CI should drive the strategic direction of the company   You 
and I both know this is not the way Enron operates  

I hope this email does not sound negative but I did want you to know that 
EBS is providing information and intelligence to its business units  it is 
just not in the context  that  Amy thinks it should be in

If you have any questions please let me know

2000-07-17T09:01:00-07:00,"I believe it is timely to discuss this again and I agree with Cynthia that 
stand alone legislation does nothing to address the essential transmission 
structural issues

I am open minded on the issue if someone can make a compelling case to 
support stand alone legislation BUT my gut reaction is that it would be  a 
serious mistake  Congress would happily put off dealing with this issue for 
years if it passes reliability only legislation  I think the legislation 
itself makes little or no progress on our issues and may even set us back on 
making progress at FERC and in other fora

I realize that if this gets going it may be hard to stop but it would be 
such a cynically ineffective approach to the real reliability problems that 
we should help whomever we can to put a stop to it  If it gets through 
committee I have no confidence in this Congress to actually amend it into 
something better and broader so again I have difficulty seeing why we 
should go that route

I look forward to the discussion

Joe  thanks  Allison is arranging a brief thirty minutes Conference Call 
for sometime tomorrow  so we can assure that we are all on the same page on 
this issue  Although we had supported the policy agreement we had been on 
record to oppose for political reasons the bills movement on a standalone 
basis since policing the grid does nothing to address the essential 
transmission structural changes the market is crying to have addressed in 
order to provide reliability  However given Jeff Browns efforts the 
political need for inoculation and other political developments it is timely 
to once again discuss Enrons position  I look forward to our call sometime

Subject Standalone Reliability Legislation


Joe

It is my understanding that you were on the call for a short time this
morning of the group dealing with reliability language  The discussion
covered the chances of standalone reliability legislation

Where do you stand on this issue

As you are aware ELCON has been opposed to any kind of standalone
legislation  including reliability  At first we were not strongly
opposed to the standalone reliability piece  However we have become more
opposed as time has passed and we have seen how the verticallyintegrated
recalcitrant utilities have been able dominate NERC and stifle any
progressive marketoriented movement  We think things would be as bad 
if not worse  with the standalone creation of NAERO  The establishment
of NAERO  alone  would not be good for the development of markets

Given this we are concerned about how things are going  However we
arent doing much on our own since we would be very ineffective  We are
open to ideas

Subject Re India And The WTO Services Negotiation  

Sanjay Some information of possible interest to you I attended a meeting 
this afternoon of the Coalition of Service Industries one of the lead groups 
promoting a wide range of services including energy services in the upcoming 
WTO GATTS  negotiations CSI President Bob Vastine was in Delhi last week 
and met with CII to discuss the upcoming WTO CII apparently has a committee 
looking into the WTO Bob says that he told them that energy services was 
among the CSI recommendations and he recalls that CII said that they too have 
an interest

Since returning from the meeting I spoke with Kiran Pastricha and told her 
the above She actually arranged the meeting in Delhi She asked that I send 
her the packet of materials we distributed last week in Brussels and London 
One of her associates is leaving for India tomorrow and will take one of 
these items to Delhi

Subject India And The WTO Services Negotiation

Sanjay First some information and then a request for your advice and 
involvment

A group of US companies and associations formed the US WTO Energy Services 
Coalition in late May and has asked the US Government to include energy 
services on their proposed agenda when the first meeting of the WTO GATTS 
 ministerial convenes late this year in Seattle Ken Lay will be among 
the CEO speakers These negotiations are expected to last three years and 
cover a range of subjects including agriculture textiles ecommerce 
investment etc

This morning I visited with Sudaker Rao at the Indian Embassy to tell him 
about our coalition and to seek his advice on possible interest of the GOI 
After all India is a leader in data processing matters and has other 
companies including ONGC that must be interested in exporting energy 
services In fact probably Enron and other US companies may be engaging them 
in India and possibly abroad

Sudaker told me that the GOI has gone through various phases of opposing the 
services round to saying only agriculture to now who knows what He agrees 
with the strategy of our US WTO Energy Services Coalition to work with 
companies and associations in asking them to contact their government to ask 
that energy services be on their list of agenda items It would seem to me 
that India has such an interest Sudaker and I agree that you are a key 
person to advise us and possibly to suggest to CII or others that they make 
such a pitch to the GOI Minister of Commerce

I will ask Lora to send you the packet of materials Chris Long and I 
distributed in Brussels and London last week I gave these materials to 
Sudaker today

Everyone tells us that we need some developing countries with an interest in 
this issue They may not know what we are doing and that they are likely to 
have an opportunity if energy services are ultimately negotiated

Please review and advise us how we should proceed We do need to get 
something done in October
Joe

PS Terry Thorn is moderating a panel on energy services at the upcoming World 
Services Congress in Atlanta The Congress will cover many services issues I 
have noted in their materials that Mr Alliwalia is among the speakers but 
not on energy services They expect people from all over the world to 
participate

Media Action
In addition to doing behind the scenes editorial board meetings and the like 
I would suggest that we get our coalition lined up and ready to release 
statements for certain key events which are likely to occur over the next 
several weeks such as

  SDGEs selection of the winning bid to their RFP  Even if Enron isnt 
selected as the winning bid the coalition should trumpet the marketbased 
solution and the enormous market response to SDGEs RFP
  The Commission vote on UCANs Emergency Motion  We should be prepared to 
issue a statement whether the Cmmn votes with us or against us  With us the 
market can and did provide reasonable expedient solutions to SDGEs 
customers and protection from price spikes  Against us despite the 
overwhelming market response the Cmmn chose to ignore the market solutions 
and impose more regulation
  Potential for ARM members to surface a Provider of Last Resort proposal 
within the next couple of weeks
  ISO Bd Mtgkeep up pressure against reducing price caps

Coalition Members

Agree that those groups listed should be contacted although the CMA CRA 
CIU CLECA have been lukewarm in their advocacy

I would add our customers UC CSU especially the San Diego branch PacTel 
etc  NewEnergy has indicated that Kroger Ralphs grocery stores San 
Diegobased would give testimonials  I could solicit the members of ARM to 
identify a key customer contacts for interviews  

We could check with our lobbyists and see who they would recommend wine 
growers dairy industry etc  We should also consider the water agencies

Subject BLM Forest Service RightofWay Update

The Senate voted on the Interior Appropriations Bill late yesterday  Our 
amendment passed which prevents either BLM or the Forest Service from 
enacting new fiber optic federal lands rightsofway policies  The BLM made 
a last ditch effort to defeat this in the Senate but we had reached key 
Senators and staff and they got nowhere

Action now moves to Conference which for us means a focus on the House 
Conference members  Scott and I will spend the next  days meeting with the 
key Republicans in the House  Weve already recruited the important 
Democrats  Interior Approps Subcommittee Chairman Regula remains opposed at 
least publicly but we think we can get other Members to swing him  We trust 
hell come up with a sensible face saving compromise on his own eg 
formally beginning a review process with his Subcommittee having oversight  
at this point our language literally forbids BLM or Forest Service from even 
meeting to discuss the issue

We continue though on several other fronts

 We have the New Dems writing OMB on the issue and several Senators and 
Congressmen writing BLM and USFS
 Weve increased the pressure on the White House and are letting them know 
through very senior back door channels that in our opinion BLM Forest 
Service have not gotten the message  Our position is that well be satisfied 
that theyve changed their evil ways when the new assessment on the Mt Hood 
EBS build is retracted
 Were preparing both Senate and House authorizing Committees for the 
longerterm issue next session  We have no trouble finding champtions eager 
to own the issue
 Were engaging the Western Caucus for same
 Our adhoc coalition continues to grow in numbers and clout with over  
companies and associations now actively engaged  Enron chairs this 
initiative with a tangible side benefit being much increased visibility and 
stature as a serious communications player
 Scott is successfully engaging state and local officials to weigh in from 
the enduser perspective

BLM is on the retreat and has asked for a meeting which weve refused   We 
dont think theyve given up though and its likely an issue of pride at 
this point  So until the Approps process concludes were continuing with the 
full court press

announcement of the panel makes it crystal clear that the objective of the 
group is to come up with standards to facilitiate competition  We will do 
nothing but waste time if it becomes a negotiation over competition  the 
best and politically easiest time to make that objective clear is in the 
original announcement not after the group gets underway  Can we get in

business practices plus add additional people to represent the internet  like 
APX Altra and HoustonStreetCom these are Steve Keans suggestions

Panel as a model since their timeline was slow but rather suggest the TVA 
Blue Ribbon Panel model since they were able to issue a report after only 
four meetings  I have asked for this issue to be brought to Secretary

Cynthia and I met with Bob Gee regarding a potential role for DOE in creating

issue  In fact Bob suggested that the reliability panel which includes a 
balance of key stakeholders could be retasked with this issue

We recommended that the focus of any panel should be on the structure 
governance segments executive committees and scope of the organization

Subject recent developments

Several recent developments and in the interest of economy mine I am 
copying all of you who will have varying interests in this

First as soon as the upper house of parliament passes legislation Austria 
will have accelerated their market oppening to  in power by  
October and by  October for gas  Sadia you will want to reflect this 
in what you are doing for Kyran EES and Kathryn you will want to note this 
if Investor Relations is updating this data for analysts  Margaret FYI to 
you too

Second I note that this decision was reached after being supported by a 
studyby the Austrian Institute of Economic Research WIFO saying 
liberalisation would bring down prices by   Paul H suggest you have 
Viviana get a copy and if in English send copies to Margaret Carson

Belgian cabinet has approved draft regulation lowering power threshold to 
GWh pa   This goes to  GWh on  December   Sadia I think this is 
again an acceleration to be reflected in your updated numbers  Margaret and 
Kathryn also note

Finally Kyran I see that EnergieNed has issued a study saying that there is 
not a direct relationship between efficiency and deregulation  I may take 
issue with this depending upon what the full text says  Can you work with 
Teun Sadia to obtain a copy and if not too lengthy get it translated for 
my review and presumably yours too  thanks

Please do not hesitate to contact me should any of you have any questions    
thanks  mcs

Thanks again for allowing me to participate in this afternoons discussion
As I mentioned I believe discussions of transmission issues must include
both jurisdictional and RTO  I understand that the RTO discussion is more
difficult in the absence of paper  For that reason I have taken the
liberty of drafting language that I believe mirrors at least my view of
one possible construct of RTO Proposal I

Subject Re Hearing

Steve  per your voicemail we do not have a date yet but should have it 
before Congress leaves next Friday  Ill let you know as soon as it is set  
As you can see I disagree with Mark per the attached email I sent him 
earlier today  I do not think it should be Jeff Skilling  Mark does not 
appear to concur with me  Perhaps I should go ahead and express our interest 
to testify and then we can have a conversation with the team to decide who 
should do it  I was just trying to not waste a chit and ask for a spot if we 
had no interest  We can determine who and what later  So before I ask the 
Committee we DO want to testify correct

Subject Re Hearing  

Mark  I disagree  The field hearings are not as high profile as a DC 
hearing  Further we can wait to see who PGE sends and others  Likely the 
California utilities will send their CEOs so if we need to be on the same 
panel with them we would need to send Jeff Skilling  But tactically we may 
not wish to do this  Otherwise we can go for a technical person or for 
someone like Steve Keanthis will be for local press and politicals more 
so than federal I doubt that more than  Congressional members even 
show  Again we have not been asked to testify  I was just trying to 
ascertain if we were interested to be askedlet me know  your further 
thoughts  thanks

2000-07-24T11:36:00-07:00,"I think you have picked the two most interesting industries  Because energy 
and telecom both have natural monopoly characteristics the government gets 
involved in economic regulation not just the usual environment safety 
labor and other types of regulation which all businesses are subject to  
That means that there is constant interplay between policy makers and the 
business community and that policy makers have alot to say about which 
business strategies will be successful

Subject Re Chorety Crisis

Steve and Mark  

I arrived in the US on Saturday with a good feeling about what appears to be 
a successful resolution of the Chorety crisis  Under Steve Hoppers 
leadership the Chorety spill became a nonissue by Friday  During the 
crisis I collaborated with my counterpart from Shell London Michael 
Megarry in developing a Key Messages and Internal QAs document attached  
At the daily meeting conference call there was an Operations Report from the 
site an analysis of the days newspaper articles which I handled and 
discussions on how to respond to media that were reporting or airing 
inaccurate information that was damaging Transredes image   

I also developed a Stakeholders Action Plan attached for the Incident 
Commander to use in organizing and monitoring team member actions taken in 
response to stakeholder concerns  The Plan was updated daily by the 
Transredes PR Office and given to team members prior to every 
meeting conference call   The Stakeholder Report is intended to complement 
the Operations Report  

I also want to acknowledge the support of Karen and Dennis during the early 
stages of the crisis  It was extremely helpful

Regards Keith

		The  Enron Net Works budget will for the first time combine allocations to business units for four key services  Enron Online IT Infrastructure Risk Management Operations and IT Maintenance and Development  We are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive  

		We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works  Some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and October   Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget

	Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year  Additions to the  ENW budget are Operations for EA EIM and EGM  Operations IT Maintenance and Development and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the    budget as well  The  budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year   Any comparison of ENWs  versus  budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant  

	For further detail for each business unit ENWs  expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business units lines of business products or commodities in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business  

	The detail that is being provided to business units for IT costs delineates licensing fees system maintenance costs and new development costs  Detail on each IT development project identifies the purpose business sponsor line of business in progress or planned designation expense and capital spend system impacted and estimated completion date   In order to finalize IT project budgets decisions will be required from the business units on which projects to undertake in

Subject	Tavel advisory  France  I thought you and Jim might like this

 The following advice for American travellers going to France was
compiled
 from information provided by the US State Department the CIA the US
 Chamber of Commerce the Food and Drug Administration the Centres for
 Disease Control
 and some very expensive spy satellites that the French dont know
about
 It
 is intended as a guide for American travellers only

 General Overview

 France is a mediumsized foreign country situated in the continent of
 Europe It is an important member of the world community though not
 nearly
 as important as it thinks
 It is bounded by Germany Spain Switzerland and some smaller nations
of
 no
 particular importance and with not very good shopping France is a
very
 old
 country with many treasures such as the Louvre and Eurodisney Among
its
 contributions to western civilization are champagne Camembert cheese
and
 the guillotine
 Although France likes to think of itself as a modern nation air
 conditioning is little used and it is next to impossible for Americans
to
 get decent Mexican food One continuing exasperation for American
visitors
 is that local people insist on speaking in French though many will
speak
 English if shouted at Watch your money at all times

 The People

 France has a population of  million people  million of these
drink
 and
 smoke the other  million are small children All French people
drive
 like lunatics are dangerously oversexed and have no concept of
standing
 patiently in a queue
 The French people are in general gloomy temperamental proud
arrogant
 aloof and undisciplined those are their good points Most French
citizens
 are Roman Catholic though you would hardly guess it from their
behaviour
 Many people are communists
 Men sometimes have girls names like Marie or Michel and they kiss
each
 other when they meet American travellers are advised to travel in
groups
 and wear baseball caps and colourful trousers for easier recognition

 Safety

 In general France is a safe destination although travellers must be
 aware
 that from time to time it is invaded by Germany Traditionally the
French
 surrender immediately and apart from a temporary shortage of Scotch
 whisky
 and increased difficulty in getting baseball scores and stock market
 prices life for the American visitor generally goes on much as
before A
 tunnel
 connecting France to Britain beneath the English channel has been
opened
 in
 recent years to make it easier for the French government to flee to
London
 during future German invasions

 History

 France historical figures are King Louis the Huguenots Joan of Arc
 Jacques Cousteau and Charles de Gaulle who was President for many
years
 and is now an airport The French were never very imaginative and all
 their
 kings were called Louis The French enjoyed their Revolution which set
up
 their republic It was so successful that they did it again and again
and
 again

 Government

 The French form of government is democratic but noisy Elections are
held
 more or less continuously and always result in a draw

 The French love administration so for government purposes the country
is
 divided into regions departments districts municipalities towns
 communes villages cafes and telephone kiosks Each of these has its
own
 government and elections Parliament consists of two chambers the
Upper
 and Lower though confusingly they are both on the ground floor and
whose
 members are either Gaullists or Communists neither of whom should be
 trusted by the traveller

 Parliaments principal occupation is testing atomic bombs in the south
 Pacific and acting indignant and surprised when other countries
complain
 and then complaining when the Arabs do the same in Paris According to
the
 most current American state department intelligence the President is
now
 someone named Jacques Further information is not available at this
time

 Culture

 The French pride themselves on their culture though it is not easy to
see
 why All their music sounds the same and they have never made a movie
that
 you would want to watch for anything but the nude scenes

 Cuisine

 Lets face  it no matter how much garlic you put on it a snail is
just a
 slug with a shell on its back Croissants on the other hand are
 excellent
 although it is impossible for most Americans to pronounce this word
In
 general travellers are advised to stick to cheeseburgers

 Economy

 France has a large and diversified economy second only to Germanys
in
 Europe which is surprising because the French hardly work at all If
they
 are not spending four hours dawdling over lunch they are on strike
and
 blocking the roads with their trucks and tractors Frances principal
 exports in order of importance to the economy are wine nuclear
weapons
 perfume guided missiles champagne guns grenade launchers land
 minestanks attack aircraft miscellaneous armaments and cheese

Rick

I have been forwarded this message quite to my surpriseconsidering my reputation  I should probably not have sent this to you but I will concede to the humour

I hope you will have fun
Antoine




 Public Holidays

 France has more holidays than any other nation in the world Among its

 national holidays are  Saints days  National Liberation Days

 Declaration of Republic Days  Return of Charles de Gaulle in
triumph as
 if he won the war singlehanded Days  Napolean sent into Exile
Days 
 Napolean Called Back from Exile Days and  France is Great and the
Rest
 of
 the World is Rubbish Days

 Conclusion

 France enjoys a rich history a picturesque and varied landscape and
a
 temperate climate In short it would be a very nice country if it was
not
 inhabited by French peopleThe best thing that can be said for France
is
 that it is not Germany"

 English if shouted at Watch your money at all times

 The People

 France has a population of  million people  million of these
drink
 and
 smoke the other  million are small children All French people
drive
 like lunatics are dangerously oversexed and have no concept of
standing
 patiently in a queue
 The French people are in general gloomy temperamental proud
arrogant
 aloof and undisciplined those are their good points Most French
citizens
 are Roman Catholic though you would hardly guess it from their
behaviour
 Many people are communists
 Men sometimes have girls names like Marie or Michel and they kiss
each
 other when they meet American travellers are advised to travel in
groups
 and wear baseball caps and colourful trousers for easier recognition

 Safety

 In general France is a safe destination although travellers must be
 aware
 that from time to time it is invaded by Germany Traditionally the
French
 surrender immediately and apart from a temporary shortage of Scotch
 whisky
 and increased difficulty in getting baseball scores and stock market
 prices life for the American visitor generally goes on much as
before A
 tunnel
 connecting France to Britain beneath the English channel has been
opened
 in
 recent years to make it easier for the French government to flee to
London
 during future German invasions

 History

 France historical figures are King Louis the Huguenots Joan of Arc
 Jacques Cousteau and Charles de Gaulle who was President for many
years
 and is now an airport The French were never very imaginative and all
 their
 kings were called Louis The French enjoyed their Revolution which set
up
 their republic It was so successful that they did it again and again
and
 again

 Government

 The French form of government is democratic but noisy Elections are
held
 more or less continuously and always result in a draw

 The French love administration so for government purposes the country
is
 divided into regions departments districts municipalities towns
 communes villages cafes and telephone kiosks Each of these has its
own
 government and elections Parliament consists of two chambers the
Upper
 and Lower though confusingly they are both on the ground floor and
whose
 members are either Gaullists or Communists neither of whom should be
 trusted by the traveller

 Parliaments principal occupation is testing atomic bombs in the south
 Pacific and acting indignant and surprised when other countries
complain
 and then complaining when the Arabs do the same in Paris According to
the
 most current American state department intelligence the President is
now
 someone named Jacques Further information is not available at this
time

 Culture

 The French pride themselves on their culture though it is not easy to
see
 why All their music sounds the same and they have never made a movie
that
 you would want to watch for anything but the nude scenes

 Cuisine

 Lets face  it no matter how much garlic you put on it a snail is
just a
 slug with a shell on its back Croissants on the other hand are
 excellent
 although it is impossible for most Americans to pronounce this word
In
 general travellers are advised to stick to cheeseburgers

 Economy

 France has a large and diversified economy second only to Germanys
in
 Europe which is surprising because the French hardly work at all If
they
 are not spending four hours dawdling over lunch they are on strike
and
 blocking the roads with their trucks and tractors Frances principal
 exports in order of importance to the economy are wine nuclear
weapons
 perfume guided missiles champagne guns grenade launchers land
 minestanks attack aircraft miscellaneous armaments and cheese

Rick

I have been forwarded this message quite to my surpriseconsidering my reputation  I should probably not have sent this to you but I will concede to the humour

I hope you will have fun
Antoine




 Public Holidays

 France has more holidays than any other nation in the world Among its

 national holidays are  Saints days  National Liberation Days

 Declaration of Republic Days  Return of Charles de Gaulle in
triumph as
 if he won the war singlehanded Days  Napolean sent into Exile
Days 
 Napolean Called Back from Exile Days and  France is Great and the
Rest
 of
 the World is Rubbish Days

 Conclusion

 France enjoys a rich history a picturesque and varied landscape and
a
 temperate climate In short it would be a very nice country if it was
not
 inhabited by French peopleThe best thing that can be said for France
is
 that it is not Germany"

Three matters

	Conference call with Staff

Particpants were  Phil Nyegaard staff lead for the Enron PGE merger and currently acting chief of staff Bryan Conway lead staff electric techie and staff on the Sierra PGE transaction Mark Helman Staff lead on PGEs rate case and the lead on the Sierra PGE transaction Lee Sparling a lead on a number of gas company cases and Bonnie Tatum lead staff gas techie  The call went well  Staff was upbeat interested but of course noncommital  They asked a number of questionsnone of them troubling  

	Timing  They asked when we wanted a OPUC order  Sue Ackerman suggested  months  Pamela Lesh suggested that we would push for a shorter time frame  Helman replied that we may be able to get this transaction done quicker but this transaction presented different issues than past cases  Helman asked suggested that we may need to propose conditions limiting anticompetitive gas vs electric practices

	Financing  Helman asked how NNG will finance the  billion cash portion of the purchse   Ackerman responded that she would provide detail on the terms and conditions of the CSFB Merrill financing  

	Other Regulatory Review  Helman asked whether the SEC would be reviewing the financial condition of the holding company  We responded that the SEC would not be focusing on the financial condition of the holding company as it will be an exempt intrastate  I explained the other regulatory processes that would apply to the transaction  Ackerman noted that the Washington Commission would review but that we expected the issues to be limited  

	Process  Nyegaard noted that Mark D and Peggy F had met with the Commissioners  He asked whether additional briefing would be necessary  I responded that our discussions with the Commissioners had been brief and focused on the overall structure of the transaction and process  I stated that we did not have any numbers at the time or other key details  We said that we intended to seek a public meeting with the full commission after our application is filed  Staff supported a public meeting on the transaction   They offered to join us in any future private meetings with the Commissioners   We said that we werent planning any addition private meetings  

	Other parties

	Sue Ackerman spoke with Bob Jenks of CUB yesterday  Her call followed our unsuccessful attempt to reach him via conference call  Jenks was interviewed by the Oregonian for todays article  He questioned NNGs ability to finance the purchase of a larger company  In his private discussion with Sue Jenks repeated his concern with NNGs ability to finance the transaction  The only other concern he raised was NNGs practice of bringing regulatory issues to the legislature  

	We were unable to reach ICNU and NWIGUbut left messages with Ken Cannon and Paula Pyronrespectively

	Rate Conditions

	Were still working on a variety of proposals for a rate condition  At this time we are considering a proposal that would mirror NNGs ROE earnings test   Under this approach PGE would   compare actual distribution system related earnings to authorized earnings  create an account which would track the difference between actual and authorized  share a certain portion of the difference between actual and authorizedabove  basis points  The sharing would not take place until the next filed rate case

	Under this approach neither PGE nor NNG would commit to a rate freeze  Parties could drag the utilities into the PUC through a show cause orderhowever note that there have not been any showcause rate cases at the OPUC in recent history  Fuel savings resulting from the merer of gas procurement activities would flow through automatically to ratepayers through NNGs PGA and through PGEs PCA of its progeny  

	PGE is conducting an analysis of this mechanism to determine its impact on earnings  We will discuss this mechanism with all of you before discussing it further with NNG  

	FERC Review

	Were pushing PGE and NNG to complete the data collection effort for CRAs market power analysis  A revised schedule for the FERC SEC OPUC and WUTC proceedings will be circulated by midweek

	The resume for Jeff Huff was inadvertently dropped from the message we sent yesterday evening  The resume is attached below for your convenience  

Below are a few points for your review

Resume Currently the second most productive Partner at DiamondCluster a technology consulting firm He has been a consultant dedicated to Enron for the last  years first for Tom Gros in EBS and Net Works and then for Dan Reck in Freight developing trading systems 
The Job We are looking to bring Jeff in as VP Commercial Support  The demands of growing the group require a consistent focus on technology expenses front and back office productivity as well as constant reanalysis of growth strategies 
Justification Jeffs capabilities in these areas make him extremely qualified We rely on him heavily already but at consulting rates he costs us more than mm per year and his focus is limited to technology Most importantly the lead commercial folks in the group are overburdened with administrative issues and spending too little time bringing in earnings 
Thank you

     Subject  Security Update


     Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world
     Some  of the changes took effect immediately eg additional security
     personnel and some are phasing in  While not all of the changes will
     be  visible  there  are  a  few  that will have an impact on everyday
     activities   In all the steps we take and recommendations we make we
     will  be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring
     to  increase  your sense of security while doing our best to minimize
     disruption to our daytoday business

     Primary  responsibility  for  Enron  Corp  Security  resides  in  our
     business  controls  organization   You  can contact this organization
     through  their  website  http  homeenroncom security  by phone
          or     by    email    
       John Brindle Senior Director
     Business  Controls  leads  this  organization   Please  feel free to
     provide  John  and  his  team  with your comments and questions or to
     report security threats

     We  have two areas to update you on  changes in the access procedures
     for  the  Enron  Center  Campus  in  Houston and changes to our travel
     advisory

     Access to the Enron Center

     Over  the  next few days the following access control procedures will
     be  instituted  at  the  Enron  Center  and  other  facilities  where
     practical

             As  employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter
             the Enron Center a guard will match the photo on the badge to
             the bearer

            Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present
             a  valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center US
             drivers  license  US  or foreign passport or some form of
             US federal state or local identification

             Visitors  to  the  Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID
             when   signing  in  at  the  lobby  reception  desk  and  must
             completely  fill out the visitor card  Adult visitors without
             a  valid  photo  ID  US  drivers  license US or foreign
             passport  or  some  form  of  US  federal  state  or local
             identification  will  not  be  allowed  access  to  the Enron
             Center

             Visitors  to  Enron  facilities  must be escorted by an Enron
             employee or badged contractor at all times

             Visitors  to  the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an
             Enron  employee  or badged contractor signed into a visitors
             log  at  the  lobby  reception  area by the employee or badged
             contractor   and  escorted  to  their  appointment   At  the
             conclusion of the appointment the visitor will be escorted to
             the  lobby  by  an  employee or badged contractor the visitor
             badge  collected and the visitor signed out in the log at the
             plaza  reception  area  by  the  escorting  employee or badged
             contractor

             Employees are also being asked to participate in the security
             of  their  workplace  by  following  these  guidelines report
             suspicious  activity  to  Security phone  do not open
             secured  doors  for  individuals  unknown to you or hold doors
             open allowing tail gating by others

     These  will  be the first in a series of new security procedures to be
     instituted  at  Enron   We  ask  that all employees be patient during
     congested  times  in  the  lobby   As we proceed and obtain increased
     guard   personnel  and  equipment  we  expect  the  inconvenience  to
     decrease   We hope you understand these measures are being instituted
     for the security of all our employees


     Travel Advisory Update

     With  the  beginning  of  retaliatory  strikes  we have two important
     recommendations

             While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing corporate security
             recommends  that  travel  through  or  to  the  Middle East be
             avoided   We  continue  to strongly recommend that all travel
             during  this  time to Afghanistan Yemen Pakistan Indonesia
             Iran Iraq Sudan Somalia Tajikistan Turkmenistan Georgia
             and   the  Kyrgyz  Republic  be  canceled   In  addition  we
             recommend  that  planned  travel  to  Egypt Israel Gaza West
             Bank  Jordan  Lebanon  Saudi  Arabia Syria and Algeria be
             very carefully considered

              For  nonUS  citizens  traveling  in  the  United  States
             corporate  security  recommends  that you carry documentation
             There  have  been  several recent reports of nonUS citizens
             who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for
             documentation  when  boarding  US  domestic  flights  As  a
             result  we  suggest  that all nonUS citizens who currently
             reside  in  the  United States  and who do not have Permanent
             Resident  Alien  status   carry their passport Form I and
             Form I at all times  We would also suggest that Permanent
             Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident Green Card as
             proof  of their status as a precautionary measure  It appears
             that  Immigration  Officials  may be applying a section of the
             Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over
             the  age  of   to carry his her registration documentation
             with  them at all times This can include a Permanent Resident
             Card  Form  I  card Employment Authorization Card Border
             Crossing  Card  or  a  Temporary  Resident  Card Immigration
             Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers
             for   registration   documentation  but  in  light  of  the
             heightened  security measures and current atmosphere it would
             be  best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving
             your current lawful status

     We  will  keep you apprised of new information and developments on the
     Corporate Security website and by email as appropriate

Mr Lay

I am writing to you this afternoon because I am concerned for the safety of me and my coworkers here at Enron  In light of the recent events that have happened I am worried that security here at Enron is still lacking  I only say this because just this morning I forgot my Enron badge so I had to get a guest pass this of course is not a big deal and happens all the time  However I had my backpack with me like usual and nobody seemed to even raise an eyebrow  Now obviously I pose zero threat to Enron but I feel like somebody who walks in with a guest pass needs only a drivers license which hasnt been a problem for most terrorists to acquire of somebody who works here at Enron  Can you see where I am going with this  

Anyway Im a first year analyst and this whole event makes me more and more nervous as time progresses and the events unfold  I only come to you with this concern because I am not the only one of my friends who have mentioned it  Please take this into consideration and know that I only raise this issue for the safety of everybody

     Travel Advisory Update

     With  the  beginning  of  retaliatory  strikes  we have two important
     recommendations

             While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing corporate security
             recommends  that  travel  through  or  to  the  Middle East be
             avoided   We  continue  to strongly recommend that all travel
             during  this  time to Afghanistan Yemen Pakistan Indonesia
             Iran Iraq Sudan Somalia Tajikistan Turkmenistan Georgia
             and   the  Kyrgyz  Republic  be  canceled   In  addition  we
             recommend  that  planned  travel  to  Egypt Israel Gaza West
             Bank  Jordan  Lebanon  Saudi  Arabia Syria and Algeria be
             very carefully considered

              For  nonUS  citizens  traveling  in  the  United  States
             corporate  security  recommends  that you carry documentation
             There  have  been  several recent reports of nonUS citizens
             who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for
             documentation  when  boarding  US  domestic  flights  As  a
             result  we  suggest  that all nonUS citizens who currently
             reside  in  the  United States  and who do not have Permanent
             Resident  Alien  status   carry their passport Form I and
             Form I at all times  We would also suggest that Permanent
             Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident Green Card as
             proof  of their status as a precautionary measure  It appears
             that  Immigration  Officials  may be applying a section of the
             Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over
             the  age  of   to carry his her registration documentation
             with  them at all times This can include a Permanent Resident
             Card  Form  I  card Employment Authorization Card Border
             Crossing  Card  or  a  Temporary  Resident  Card Immigration
             Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers
             for   registration   documentation  but  in  light  of  the
             heightened  security measures and current atmosphere it would
             be  best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving
             your current lawful status

     We  will  keep you apprised of new information and developments on the
     Corporate Security website and by email as appropriate

Mr Kean
I want to thank you and your group for keeping us informed of new safety
rules so we all understand the reasons for the changes  I have 
question

Will you be sharing reviewing revising fire drill building evacuation
instructions  In the past our fire drills have instructed us just to
go
to the door of the stairwells  If we really had to evacuate the
building
where should we go after we exit the stairwells and building  Would the
recommendation be to wait in the park area in front of ECN walk towards
an
area that is not near high structures a freeway underpass etc or is
that
decision left to our discretion

I think it makes sense to send somebody from Enron to make a presentation
given our relationship with the Wharton School I  think it can be somebody
below Steves level  the occasion does not justify allocating
time of a senior executive

I have received an inquiry from a professor at the Wharton School who
would like to invite a senior executive from Enron to speak at their
Energy Club I gave him your name so you can expect a call from him or one
of his associates

Sorry if I put another burden on your shoulders

We are moving along on the weather derivatives project  Had a good meeting with Joe Hrgovic and others on the project and we are now interviewing a number of distribution utilities

On another note our Energy Club is fairly active at Wharton and would be very interested in featuring Terence Thorn if he is still with Enron or your senior Government Affairs person if Mr Thorn has left Enron  Could you kindly let me know how to contact Mr Thorn or his replacement so I can speak with him her briefly  My alterior motive in asking you to do this is that you might copy him on your email to me so that he knows we are doing some work together

Thanks in advance

The speaker from Enron that I told you yesterday that I was interested in bringing in for the Energy Club Speaker Series is Terence H Thorn senior vice president Environmental and International Government Affairs A colleague of mine heard him speak in Kyoto in  and said he gave a superb talk As of  he was still in this position though I could not verify that he is now

The proposed topic is Global Warming Policy and the Energy Industry
How will the Bonn agreement affect global strategy What will be the nearterm and longterm consequences of the agreement
How does US nonparticipation affect US market strategies versus strategies in participating countries
What is Enrons current position on global greenhouse gas policy How is Enron managing and hedging this position
How will developing country energy markets participate in greenhouse gas mitigation

The Energy Club Speaker Series takes place every other Monday from  to  There are a number of dates open during Fall semester

I appreciate very much your help in trying to arrange this Please let me know if there is any other information you need

Thank you
Amy

Hi Michael

Remember we talked about the Kyoto conference and you said you heard the
Govt Affairs guy at Enron give an amazing speech about global warming I
ran the idea to get a speaker on global warming by the nd yr in charge
of the Energy Club http  dolphinupennedu energy and he thought
that would be great And furthermore the prof who I do research
forPaul Kleindorfersaid he is very well connected with the big guys at
Enron and would love to jointly sponsor the talk SO do you remember
the guys name Was it Robert Reilly possibly I dont know if he would
still be there but we can try

Thanks

2001-10-12T15:36:38-07:00,Stan Horton called about the production tax credit for Enron Wind Enron Wind is one of the many companies hes responsible for and he is going to be getting more deeply involved at least on this issue  I will forward your latest update originally to Mark Metts but I think you should provide a new update for Stan as well as a discussion of what we are doing or should be doing to get the extension
2001-10-12T15:40:17-07:00,"Here is the most recent update I have  I have asked our DC office to give you a further updat and to look into what else we should be doing
The summary below is a bit dated as is everything done before sept   Congress is now expected to adjourn this month not next  Otherwise the report on the prognosis for ultimate passage remains accurate I believe

Subject RE Wind Production Tax Credit PTC


Amit  Congress is on recess until September and will not adjourn in October as planned  We expect Congress to be in session until late November or even into December 

The PTC extension was passed out of the House in its energy package it was part of the tax title  The Senate Committee is expected to consider its version of the energy in September into October  We expect the PTC to pass in the Senate as well

Now to the timing it is unclear if the energy package with the PTC extensionwill move before Congress adjourns for the year  If it does not then Congress can pass what it calls an extenders package which would extend all tax credits that are set to expire at the end of the year  If that were to not happen then Congress could send notice to the Administration that it plans to pass the PTC and other extenders early next year and make it retroactive until December    Any of theses scenarios is possible

While nothing is  when you deal with Congress I think it highly likely the PTC will be extended either this year or retroactively next  The question then becomes for how long  The House bill extends it for five years and we are pushing for longer in the Senate  I do not think a permanent extension is possible given the revenue numbers

Let me know if you need additional information

					Mark  I left a voice mail on your cell

					The Wind Production Tax Credit expires on December     The PTC will be extended   There is significant bipartisan support for the PTC the revenue number is reasonable and renewables are a key component of the energy debate

					The question is when and how  Two likely scenarios are

					  As part of the Energy Bill  The House Ways and Means Committee will markup the tax portions of the energy bill in midJuly  We understand that Chairman Thomas is committed to including the PTC as part of the Ways and Means bill  The Senate Finance Committee has not scheduled a markup  While the energy bill will be debated during July final action will likely not occur until after the August recess   In this scenario look to September at the earliest

					  There are  provisions including the PTC  in the IRC that expire by December     Historically Congress approves an extenders package late in the session to keep the tax credits functioning   While no one can predict when Congress will adjourn they are set to adjourn in early October  In this scenario the PTC would be extended in late September at the earliest

					Mark this is Congress so anything can change  

					Call me with any questions at

I was wondering if  you would have  minutes to meet with me sometime in the near future for  confidential reasons You asked me on Monday if everything is all right and  the answer is not really I request this meeting for personal reasons more on  mentor basis than employee to employer 
 
Would that be  possible If so I would also request that we meet early in the morning or on a  conference room on another floor It is difficult to meet on this  floor without everyone immediately knowing questioning your intentions

Request Is ICE regulated by the CFTC
Response The Intercontinental Exchange ICE is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission only to the extent the markets are made on the exchange for products that have already been designated futures contracts by the commission 
 
ICE announced  August that its new clearing house the formerly the London Clearing House of the International Petroleum Exchange would clear cashsettled US oil swaps for West Texas Intermediate crude and US natural gas swaps at the Henry Hub Since both of these underlying products trade as futures contracts in the US the derivative product traded on ICE is regulated as well The fact that the futures trade on another exchange the New York Mercantile Exchange is immaterial
 
The ICE said its London Clearing House has applied to the CFTC for recognition as a Derivatives Clearing Organization DCO Section bd of the Commodities Exchange Act as added by the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of  CFMA  provides that DCOs shall be deemed to be registered under this section to the extent that the DCO clears agreements contracts or transactions for a board of trade that has been designated by the Commission as a contract market for such agreements contracts or transactions before the date of enactment of this section This provision captures all futures clearing organizations that have ever cleared any futures contracts for designated contract markets before the CFMA became effective
 
DCOs of both traditional open outcry exchanges as well as electroniconly exchanges have been approved by the CFTC Applications by the Intercontinental Exchange and Hedge Street Inc appear to be pending  A CFTC official told Intellibridge that few applications to create DCOs have been submitted since the CFMA was signed

in that context that I write 

I know you are familiar with The Houston Forums longstanding reputation as 
the preeminent speakers forum in Houston I know they welcome your support 
and sponsorship in any way you deem appropriate but we hope Enron is able to 
participate as a program underwriter and or sponsor The following is a list 
of the confirmed speakers over the next several months as well as those 
pending for  

 The Honorable Alberto Gonzales Cousel to the President George  W Bush 
will join us for a luncheon program on Sept th at the Houston Club This 
program is being done in conjunction with the Houston Bar Association

 Septemeber th is our Energy Roundtable luncheon programmoderated by 
Matt Simmons of Simmons  Coat the Hyatt Regency 

 On October rd we host Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailandthe director 
General of the World Trade Organization This is a luncheon program to be 
held at the Houston Club 

 November th we will welcome presidential historian and analyst Michael 
Beschloss Dr Beschloss will discuss his most recent publication on the 
tapes of President Lyndon Johnson This will be a very popular event and 
there are special sponsorship opportunities attendant with it

Ambassador to the United States This afternoon program will take place at 
the Junior League 

 March   is the date for our luncheon program at the Hyatt Regency

If I might let me share with you the particulars of the sponsorships and 
underwriting options available to  you 

A sponsorship of  will enable you or your designee to introduce the

Steve and Rick  You may have heard that EBS is winding down its business in the Asia Pacific region  This is of course greatly disappointing for everyone involved but is the right thing to do given the status of the industry here  We have a great team in the region and I am trying to help members of the team find new homes in Enron  Along those lines I wanted to bring Maurice Nunas to your attention  Maurice joined EBS this past June and is Director of Government Affairs for the region  We were fortunate to land Maurice from Motorola in Singapore  Maurice is a recognized expert  on telecommunications regulations in Asia and has excellent working relationships with a number of governmental bodies and NGOs across the region  In a short period of time Maurice has made significant progress on a number of governmental and regulatory issues that were facing us in the region  He has proven adept at picking up the fundamentals of the Enron business model and has skills that would transfer across a number of commodities  Maurice is interested in staying with Enron and working in Houston elsewhere in North America or in the Asia Pacific region  since he is new to Enron and does not have extensive relationships around the organization I thought I would forward his cv to you as you are in a superior position to know what the various business units needs may be  Thanks for your consideration  please feel free to forward Maurices resume or to let me know what I can do to further his placement in Enron  

I hope all is well with both of you  Regards

Mark Im sure you are aware of the comments in the press that I have copied and inserted here below  There have been others that are similar  Basically the press is reporting that we have dissolved the LJM partnerships ended all relationships with the LJM entities etc  All that we have done is unwind the raptor entities LJM still exists all other transactions with LJM still exist its just that Andy sold his interest in the partnerships  Michael Kopper owns them and would probably be considered a friend of Enron by investors journalists

Im concerned about our efforts to build back investor confidence  do we correct the press  how do we address this  Im concerned that we will once again be hit with credibility concerns when the press or investors fully understand that LJM still exists and we have deals still pending with it and have deals still in place with it  How do we correct this erroneous press   Sherron Watkins

Excerpts
Enron  has been under fire since last week as questions have surfaced about its accounting practices especially in regard to two limited partnerships created by Fastow in  and since dissolved  By Lisa Sanders  CBSMarketWatchcom
Last Update  AM ET Oct  
So Fastow in June resigned his roles at the partnerships and Enron also ended its relationships with the LJM entities Houston Chronicle article from today

We could reach the page where one then clicked to enter the broadcast but

We tried to access both the Enron live and archived broadcasts using 
different computers including the web via Bloomberg using three different
ISPs and also three different platforms  Windows Windows NT and MAC 
We also tried both RealAudio and Windows Media Player on each computer 
We took the extra step to download the fresh versions of RealAudio and

fine  Four CW persons tried independently to access Enrons braodcast

With heightened security concern in the building this morning I wanted to report two items

 When I parked in the Allen Center Garage this morning level  yellow section at the top of the stairs from the Enron building just under the covered area I noticed a large brown copper truck  I park my blue explorer in this same spot every day and I have never seen this truck before  Its probably nothing just wanted to report it

 When I reached my desk this morning I wanted to call in this concern  I pulled up the corporate security number listed on the website   The woman that answered the phone was rude and said that the number wasnt corporate security but rather building security  she laughed and didnt seem remotely interested in my concern  Perhaps I misunderstood the website posting about who to call with security concerns  But if I did perhaps other employees will as well

Hi Karen

Sue did a great job today at the VICA meeting  I wish I could take Sue and
fellow speaker Fred Pickle up and down the State of California to talk to
business associations about energy

The audience was very receptive to the presentation  Now that the energy
crisis has moved off the front page and the legislature is out of session
people seem better able to absorb the magnitude and longterm ramifications
of long term contracts the end of direct access etc

David Horowitz spent more time talking about telco deregulation than
electricity  He is clearly more comfortable talking about telco and was
completely unaware of current events at Enron  David Freeman did not show
up and he didnt send anyone in his place

Carolyn Casavan VICA cochair of the energy  environment committee told
Sue to call if there was anything that VICA could do to support efforts to
reinstate direct access to please call

Hope you have a good weekend

Talk to you soon

Subject	CA Refund Case Information PRIVILEGED  CONFIDENTIAL

Steve  

Jim Steffes called me to inquire as to the information you are interested in regarding the California refund case and I passed the following along to him by phone


Status of the refund claim  

The CAISO refund claims made in CAISO letters to Congress and the final claim at the FERCordered settlement conference were approximately  MM  The initial claim in the California Refund case before Judge Birchman was very similar although the most recent CAISO claim is that they owe us MM  A review of their claim revealed errors  I asked Charles River Associates to rerun the numbers correcting only the errors and they came up with a MM figure  Please note that this number resulted from an internal exercise and is not a claim by the ISO  However I consider this the maximum exposure from what is known at this time  I expect that CAISO will revise its claim against us around December  and I will communicate the new claim as soon as I receive it


Points summarizing the proceeding

The California refund proceeding at FERC unlike the Pacific Northwest proceeding contemplates that refunds will be paid and orders the Judge to determine the amount of the refunds
Issues to be decided by the Judge include  the amounts of the mitigated market claiming price  the amounts owed by each seller and  the amount that a seller may offset against its refund obligation
This proceeding has been delayed due to errors and omissions in the California ISOs data
Due to deficiencies in the data it is also difficult to assess potential exposure The California ISOs claims have thus far been erroneous
Hearings are scheduled to occur on December  and February  The Judges ruling is expected on March   

Timing of the FERC Order
It is difficult to say how quickly the Commission may rule after receiving the Judges certification of findings and record on March   Arguably they could act very quickly due to the limited scope of the proceeding and the fact that the Judges findings will likely be limited to the three issues described above

Let me know if you need any more information  I will copy you on significant memos in the case  Regards  Ray

Subject	RED Index shows Texas NY and Maine advance on retreating Pennsylvania

Note to Steven Kean

The July Update to the Retail Energy Deregulation Index RED Index
published twice a year by the Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets
CAEM shows Texas Maine and New York are making the most measurable
strides in promoting sustainable competition among electricity providers as
customers throughout Pennsylvania retreat to their default providers due to
increasing wholesale prices

The RED Index which is the only known tool that objectively ranks states by
 attributes on how they are restructuring their power markets today
released the US rankings for all  states and the District of Columbia
in a  page report  Key results included
		  Pennsylvania		 		 
		  Texas		 		 		 
		  New York		 		 		 
		  Maine		 		 		 
		  California		 		 		 

These numbers underscore the importance of building a healthy foundation on
which electric competition can grow said Ken Malloy CEO of the Center

While Californias crisis has brought a lot of positive attention to
Pennsylvanias model many customers in the Keystone State are returning to
their original utility suppliers  It underscores how important it is to put
the right fundamentals in place if consumers and suppliers are to benefit
over the long haul Malloy said

In rankings that included all of North America the province of Alberta
actually would rank above all the states with a score of 

The midyear RED Index also found that  of states expressing an opinion
indicated that their commission is not less likely to take action on energy
restructuring as a result of the California crisis

CAEM is an independent nonprofit think tank based in Washington DC whose
mission is to promote an effective transition from the monopoly to the
competitive model of regulation

   George Howell              HR View Basic Data  Org ENTP      View Payroll and Time  

Please note I am not requesting access for the entire department  the list of employees above are the only individuals in our group that will be allowed this type of access Corps payroll accounting group is responsible for reconciling the general ledger balance sheet accounts across all Enron companies therefore Enterprise access is needed

The requested access is essential for our group to perform our job   Without this we are unable to trace amounts related to FIT FICA net pay stock option deductions etc  through the payroll system to the ledger and to ensure that the items are accounted for properly   Equally as important  the access enables us to identify system issues between PR payroll and PR ledger   Corps payroll accounting group has already identified several processing issues and alerted the ISC   

I hope this pleads our case on why we need the access and request it be reactivated    Please feel free to call me or Mark Lindsey if you need additional information

	Government and regulator continue to be supportive of our shutdown and inspection action plan  We have developed a contingency plan with COBEE the regional electricity distributor under which they will redistribute energy out of spare capacity in Cochabamba to LaPaz   this should cover LaPazs electricity needs during the duration of time we need to complete our inspection  The only other significant consumer is a large cement plant in LaPaz  Weve agreed that they will slow down their operations and provide only small local supplies industrial concrete demand will be shutin

	We did not send a press release on the issue although we have received inquiries  our response is that we are concerned about the risk to Bolivians this action presented and we are performing an inspection on the system  We are avoiding mention of gas stoppage to LaPaz at this time due to the volatility of the issue in LaPaz  Government VMEH SIRESE has agreed with the message

	We expect that with the cement plant and power plant offline line pack should be sufficient to keep commercial demand satisfied for a few days  In either event we are working with the local gas distributor to prepare a notice for LaPaz newspapers instructing gas consumers in the area how to safely shutdown and restart their equipment in the event that it becomes necessary

	The most likely scenario as of now is that Edwin Morales  a local revolutionary tied to the coca trade  is behind the action  Morales has had contact in the past with the Raul Rocha bunch out of Chuquina Oruro so were still not sure whether this was an act against TR and or the industry or if it is against government  Morales has just joined forces with another rebel out of Cochabamba and is planning nationwide road blocks for tomorrow  Their agenda is national  theyve never isolated TR or our industry as a whole although Chaco in the north have been targeted in the past probably because they have a field in the middle of Morales stronghold  The political situation here is tenuous with Banzer out and various political interests looking to fill the leadership void  Were watching this situation closely  The local Army brigade has committed to staying on vigilance for at least the next few days  once were comfortable with the operational situation well discuss a longerterm solution

	At  pm today a CLHB line walker discovered a bomb on their LPG line in the Altiplano  km from out SicaSica station  Our OSSA II crude exports to Chile and GAA gas to LaPaz share the same ROW and would likely have been taken out with the bomb  We understand that the bomb which had a manual fuse did not go off but had been lit and failed to explode  The Army has been mobilized to diffuse the bomb and we consider the immediate threat neutralized

	However given that we have now seen several attempts in the last  days of sabotage against our lines I have declared a state of EMERGENCY and will notify the Enron Crisis team

	We have shut all Altiplano pipeline operations down and have mobilized a joint CLHB TR Army team to perform vigilance on the entire altiplano network  The immediate result of this is that lights will likely start to go out in LaPaz within the next few hours  the GAA line is their primary power fuel supply  Ive notified all relevant government authorities of the situation and so far am getting support  Ive also asked the Embassy to look into the situation with the understanding that if this is the result of an organized movement they might have access to intelligence that could be helpful

	Additionally weve shut down all noncritical maintenance operations throughtout the rest of the system and are directing spare personnel to perform vigilance on the remainder of the system as quickly as possible  Until and unless we have information that this threat goes beyond the altiplano we will continue operations with all stations on alert  We will kick off the the total system inspection within the next few hours as soon as our people complete the overall plan

	I will keep you posted as things develop

Subject	California Update 

The Senate the Assembly and the Governor are either poised to engage in very difficult negotiations or the three are about to crash and burn and Edisons going to be left dangling

In the Senate
The Senate bill XX is with about  likelihood going to be voted out of the Senate tonightwithout a vote having taking place in any committee
Burton announced during one of the two informational hearings that this is it despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the committees the bill likely wont prevent Edison from going bankrupt
The key features of the bill are
Banks and QFs get paid in full
Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers
No direct access
There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill tomorrow delinking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the Republicans will go along with it

In the Assembly
The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak with Hertzbergs the likely winner
That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions the amendments describing the conditions were faxed today
Were attempting to get the July  date changed to the effective date of the bill or later
The Assembly likely wont vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the earliest

The Problem
The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each approaches the problemin short the bills are two ships passing in the night
The Democratic leaders Governor Hertzberg Burton arent talking and Burton hasnt expressed any interest in talkingto anybody

The likely outcome given the circumstances  
Burton says hes done what he needs to do ie passed out a fair bill the Assembly and Senate cant agree they finish the budget time runs out they leave Friday and Edisons left twisting

That said theres still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday or begin talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out  But given Burton the chance of that happening seems very slim

In short little has changed since yesterday

What people know

Hertzberg et als bill XXwas heard in an informational hearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee  It will be heard again tomorrow perhaps beginning at  AM  at which time parties will have a chance to support oppose and ask for amendments  Most including us oppose unless significantly amended
The Wright D Richman R bill XXwas heard in an informational hearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee  It will be heard again tomorrow at which time parties will have a chance to support oppose and ask for amendments  From our perspective this is the best bill out there yet though it still has serious problemsit isnt available electronically yet but should be tomorrow and Ill distribute then  The chances of the joint DR bill being successful are slim however since its up against the Speakers competing bill  There is talk that the Speaker will try to negotiate with Wright Richman tonight and include any agreement in his bill XX
The original version of the Governors MOU bill sits in the Senate  Most believe that Burton will put it up for a vote this week and it will fail
The Senates version of the MOU SherPeaceKuehl XXcame out today  It will likely be heard in the committee tomorrow or the next day  Notably it kills Direct Access completely and makes Edison shareholders responsible for that portion of Edisons debt owed to suppliers  In short a very bad bill
Burtons XX which would delink the bond issuance to pay back the General Fund from the DWR contracts is likely to pass the Senate tomorrow or the next day  Manyincluding Enronsupport the bill though we are supporting it behind the scenes

What people dont know
Whether theres the time or the will in the Assembly and Senate to achieve by Friday a single comprehensive bill that can be sent to the governor for his signature 
Whether the Legislature would postpone its monthlong recess if the Legislature hasnt finished a bill by Friday most folks think they will not postpone
Whether its true that irrespective of the energy issue the Legislature will fail to get the budget completed by Friday and therefore have to postpone their recess anyway in which case they might continue to work on the energy legislation at the same time

Oddsmakers still say its better than  that the Legislature does not get the Edison bills done by Friday and leaves on on its day vacation

We have been approached by the Texas AM George Bush Presidential Library Foundation and School of Public Policy to endow additional funds

Enron had made an original contribution to the library foundation back in  totaling K over five years

I am working with Community Relations and A A Recruiting to evaluate the latest request and to discuss where Enron may have interest or find leverage for our Government Affairs Recruiting or PR efforts

The Foundation is willing to work with us to establish whatever type of programs and or participatory involvement we would like  We have discussed an Enron speaker series classroom lectures advisory committee seats and the likes

I have already had a chance to run this by Rick Shapiro and Rob Bradley  Although Rick was noncommittal regarding his teams time for speaking or lecturing he seemed supportive of the effort  Rob has already been participating in some speaking opportunities there and supported expanded efforts

What are your thoughts on contribution levels another K was suggested by CR and any specific program or relationship opportunities regarding the Library Center or School of Public Policy

Wisconsin Gas to Purchase Nine Mile Line From Northern Natural Gas

Line Will Enhance Competition in Southeast Wisconsin and Use Existing 
Facilities 

MILWAUKEE July   PRNewswire   Wisconsin Gas Northern Natural Gas and Guardian Pipeline announced today that Wisconsin Gas has signed an agreement with Northern Natural Gas NNG to purchase a nine mile high pressure natural gas pipeline in Walworth and Waukesha counties The purchase price is  million The proposed transaction will require approval from federal and state regulators The pipe known as the Eagle line is located southeast of the Kettle Moraine Forest near Eagle Wis
The existing line has been part of the NNG interstate transmission system Under the new ownership the line will become part of the Wisconsin Gas distribution system and will interconnect with Guardian Pipeline as well as the NNG system 
Northern Natural Gas is pleased to be a part of a creative costeffective solution to provide additional gas service to southeastern Wisconsin said Dave Neubauer vice president of business development and marketing Northern Natural Gas This transaction enables Wisconsin Gas and its customers to obtain natural gas supplies from Guardian or NNG Providing reliable economical choices for consumers will benefit all of the parties involved 
We saw this as an opportunity to minimize environmental impact and still realize the benefits of increased competition in the natural gas market said James Schott senior vice president Wisconsin Gas The purchase of the Eagle line will enable Wisconsin Gas to further our goal of providing costefficient natural gas service to our customers 
As a result of the purchase Guardian Pipeline the mile interstate pipeline from Joliet Ill to Ixonia Wis will no longer build an mile lateral to Eagle The lateral was part of the originally certified Guardian Pipeline This portion of the line would have generally run parallel to the current Northern Natural pipeline 
This sale is a winwin situation for Guardian and consumers said George Hass project manager of Guardian Pipeline The Eagle line purchase by Wisconsin Gas saves Guardian time and resources by taking away the need to build the mile lateral and allows all three companies to create a better environment for competition in the natural gas marketplace 
The existing gate stations at LaGrange and Eagle will remain inservice for regulation purposes Odorization and measurement will take place at a new gate station that will be constructed at the interconnect with Guardian This new gate station will be called the Bluff Creek station and will be located near Whitewater The Bluff Creek gate station will be constructed during the construction of Guardian Pipeline 
Northern Natural Gas a subsidiary of Enron Corp with a market area capacity of about  Bcf d provides natural gas transportation services to utility customers in the upper Midwestern United States through its approximately  miles of pipeline 
Guardian Pipeline is a partnership of three Midwestern energy companies CMS Energy based in Dearborn Mich Wisconsin Energy headquartered in Milwaukee Wis and Viking Gas Transmission Co a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc and located in St Paul Minn

Commodities Review LME Copper Hit By Another Stock Rise
By Mark Long and Steve McGrath
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

  
Dow Jones Commodities Service
Copyright c  Dow Jones  Company Inc

LONDON Dow Jones Copper futures traded in London fell Friday as a further influx of stocks into official warehouses put the copper market under pressure and dragged down the rest of the base metal complex 
Threemonth copper traded on the London Metal Exchange ended  down from Thursdays late kerb close at  a metric ton
An increase of  tons of copper into LME warehouses Friday brought total stocks up to a month high of  tons This pressured prices in early trade down to test  ton support although prices recovered slightly in later trade 
Unconfirmed market talk said Enron is behind much of the weeks stock rise in an effort to ease nearby supply tightness and to alleviate the large short positions it is thought to have built up on the Julyforaweek spread which is currently showing a  ton backwardation The July futures contract will switch over to cash Monday 
Enron declined to comment on the market talk Friday 
A backwardation is a pricing structure in which deliveries to be made in the near future are more expensive then those set for a more distant delivery The opposite situation is called contango 
The spreads are still tight The major longs are still reluctant to lend with no signs of that tightness dissipated said Kevin Norrish an analyst with Barclays Capital in London 
Dealers and analysts said they expect further stock increases next week 
The entire base metals complex ignored Thursdays point rally in the Dow Jones Industrial Average dealers said 
Copper has been sensitive to moves in the stock market but not this time Norrish said In fact now it appears that base metals markets ignore equities markets when they rally but follow stocks down when they slump he added 
European Grain Futures See ProfitTaking But More Gains Expected 
European grain and oilseed futures were hit by a bout of profittaking and preweekend positionsquaring Friday after rising to longtime highs brokers said 
However world and domestic crop concerns the strength of the dollar and general bullish sentiment will carry the markets to fresh highs short term they said 
On the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange the benchmark November feed wheat contract ended just  pence up at GBP ton after hitting a new twoyear high of GBP ton in early trade 
Meanwhile Matif November rapeseed futures fell EUR on the day to EUR ton after hitting a threeyear high of EUR ton in early trade 
The UK wheat crop and the French rapeseed crop are forecast to be well down on last year and wheat and canola crops in some other major producing countries are also expected to fall 
Meanwhile the strength of the dollar is allowing European grain and oilseed traders to up prices and still remain competitive against US imports and dollardenominated grains on the world market

Aluminum   Zinc   
Nickel   Lead   
Comex Sep Copper  
An increase of  tons of copper Friday brought total stocks up to a month high of  tons This pressured prices in early trade down to test  ton support before rising slightly to close at  ton down from Thursdays close of  ton 
Unconfirmed market talk said Enron is behind much of the weeks stock rise in an effort to ease nearby supply tightness and to alleviate the large short positions it is thought to have built up on the Julyforaweek spread which is currently showing a  ton backwardation The July futures contract will switch over to cash Monday 
Enron declined to comment on the market talk 
A backwardation is a pricing structure in which deliveries to be made in the near future are more expensive then those set for a more distant delivery The opposite situation is called contango 
The spreads are still tight The major longs are still reluctant to lend with no signs of that tightness dissipated said Kevin Norrish an analyst with Barclays Capital in London 
Dealers and analysts said they expect further stock increases next week 
The entire base metals complex ignored Thursdays point rally in the Dow Jones Industrial Average dealers said 
Copper has been sensitive to moves in the stock market but not this time Norrish said In fact now it appears that base metals markets ignore equities markets when they rally but follow stocks down when they slump he added 
Aluminum also ended the late kerb lower Friday 
News of the restart of some smelters has dampened sentiment despite a stock drawdown of around  tons since the end of last week dealers said 
The stock drawdowns are fairly small percentagewise said Standard Bank analyst Robin Bhar adding that they would need to be much larger to significantly improve market sentiment 
A test of  ton cannot be ruled out though we would expect forward buying to prevent a break below this level for the time being Barclays said in a market report 
Zinc continued its slump falling to a sevenandahalfyear low mainly on technicals 
Technicals also hurt nickel which rose slightly after breaking  ton support but still closed at its lowest level since April 
Nickels fall was just on some speculative liquidation and short selling mostly chartbased Bhar said

UK Telecoms drugs drive FTSE  rally Vodafone leads
By Camila Reed

  
Reuters English News Service
C Reuters Limited 

LONDON July  Reuters  Britains largest companies raced higher at the close on Friday fired by telecoms and drug stocks as they bounced back from Wednesdays week low 
Index heavyweights Vodafone and GlaxoSmithKline provided  of the days point gain while technology firms wobbled However the telecoms giant surged  percent to  p
The FTSE  finished  points or one percent firmer at  having jumped  percent on Thursday after seven consecutive losing sessions with gainers outnumbering losers by three to one 
Stocks steamed higher and refused to be derailed by sluggish US retail sales figures for June which showed only a meagre rise and a weaker Wall Street but volumes were thin at  billion shares 
By Londons  GMT finish the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was down five points while the techladen Nasdaq Composite Index was flat having streaked up in the previous session 
Mike Lenhoff and Simon Rubinsohn at money managers Gerrard said that the UK equity market was deeply oversold and longterm this presented a buying opportunity for UK equities 
DRUGS SEESAW 
Drugs reversed an earlier decline with Nycomed Amersham among the days top performers up nearly four percent at  p and AstraZeneca rising over one percent 
Mining giant Anglo American moved into the FTSE  top ten gainers with a three percent rise as investors sought refuge in mining stocks as a cyclical play 
Another major gainer was British business services firm Hays Plc up  percent The shares leapt on market talk that Germanys Deutsche Post was looking to make a bid for it dealers said 
Both Deutsche Post and Hays declined to comment 
Firmer crude prices gave support to the oil sector BP rose  percent to  pence and Shell also added  percent to  p lifting the index by four points 
FTSE MIXED PICTURE 
But dealers and analysts said it would be a mixed picture going forward with the market scrutinising data for signs of a sustained economic recovery or a lapse in consumer confidence 
This week we had a really bloody day on Wednesday and then the opposite on Thursday so were going to be on a rollercoaster still Its very fragile but it does show the potential of the market said Foreign  Colonial director of UK equities David Manning 
Its not only the holiday period its also that the market can make you look an idiot one day to the next In that sort of circumstance the temptation is to do very little he said 
ABN Amro strategist Gareth Williams said the market would make modest progress over the next month or so with moves downward quite likely although the trend would be upwards over the course of the year 
TECHS DIP 
Thursdays percent rally in the Nasdaq failed to bring any cheer to UK technology shares Logica and Colt Telecom slid four percent while microchip designer ARM fell  percent to  pence trimming Thursdays  percent jump 
The techMARK index of technology shares rose  percent to  
Elsewhere on the downside UK holiday operator Airtours lost nearly  percent of its value after Swiss peer Kuoni issued a profit warning

The FTSE  Midcap index finished  points stronger at  
Among smallcaps Paladin Resources shares jumped  percent after the UK oil explorer said that major shareholder US oil giant Enron had sold the whole of its millionshare stake via HSBC bank for  pence a share 
Britains Litho Supplies Plc slumped  percent after the company which supplies printing and graphic arts products said that sales in the first six months of  were on target but profits would likely be below expectations due to tough market conditions and pressure on margins

Futures Contract Covering Coal Debuts in New York Correct

Futures Contract Covering Coal Debuts in New York Correct

     Corrects location of FirstEnergy Corp in th paragraph of
story that moved yesterday

     New York July  Bloomberg  The New York Mercantile
Exchange today began trading a futures contract for lowsulfur
coal a fuel that President George W Bush said will play a major
role in meeting electricity demand over the next two decades
     The contracts debut came after prices for coal considered
the dirtiest of powerplant fuels doubled in the past year as
demand from power plants outstripped mine production Coal for
September delivery opened at  a ton and settled at  as
 contracts were traded exchange officials said
     We had a big runup in coal prices this past winter said
Andy Ozley who buys coal for Atlantabased Mirant Corps six
coal plants in New York Illinois Maryland and Virginia This
contract affords us a way to mitigate our exposure to large
price swings
     The Bush administration said in an energy policy report this
spring that coal would be the dominant fuel for electricity
generation through  Bush gave an added boost to the fuel when
he retreated from a campaign pledge to restrict carbon dioxide
emissions implicated in global warming
     Coal plants are responsible for a third of the nations
carbon dioxide emissions They also produce sulfur dioxide which
causes acid rain and nitrogen oxides which cause smog
     The Nymex started the futures contract to give mining
companies and utilities a way to hedge their risks in the 
billion coal market Producers such as Peabody Energy Corp and
Arch Coal Inc whose shares have soared in the past year have
said they would trade the futures

                            New Plants

     Last years quadrupling of prices for natural gas  a
cleanerburning powerplant fuel  prompted many generators to
ramp up output from their coal plants Utility coal stockpiles
dwindled and prices have risen to their highest levels since at
least 
     So far this year more than a dozen companies have announced
plans to build coalfired plants including Kansas City Missouri
based Kansas City Power  Light Co and Portland Oregonbased
PacifiCorp
     Although coal is used to produce  percent of the nations
electricity few plants were built during the s because of the
high costs of building them and the difficulty of complying with
federal and local environmental regulations
     Demand for coal has eased in recent weeks as belownormal
temperatures in the US Midwest and Northeast reduced demand for
air conditioning said Jim Parks who buys coal for six power
plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania as director of fuels at Akron
Ohiobased FirstEnergy Corp
     The summers been pretty mild so far  you havent seen
any big heat waves in regions with the most coal generation he
said

                           Big Sandy

     The Nymex futures contract calls for the delivery of 
tons of lowsulfur coal to the mouth of the Big Sandy River near
Huntington West Virginia From there the fuel would be loaded
onto Ohio River barges and shipped to power plants in the US and
possibly Europe
     The new contract is tailored to producers in Appalachian
states that account for about  percent of US production
including West Virginia Kentucky and Pennsylvania the No  
and  coal producers
     The industry lacks a futures contract for coal from Western
states that account for  percent of the nations production
including the No  producer Wyoming

                         Avoiding the Past

     The exchange which earns commissions on trades hopes coal
futures will avoid the fate of other contracts it has started over
the past few years Its six electricity futures contracts have
fizzled as has its Middle East sour crude oil contract which
debuted in May 
     I said yesterday if you traded  to  contracts that
would be a really a good day said Chris Casale vice president
of energy trading at Dynegy Inc in Houston which trades coal and
buys the fuel for its six power plants in New York and Illinois
It came out sort of on target
     Most of todays trading was originated by large energy
marketing companies he said although he declined to say whether
Dynegy traded any contracts Enron Corp the largest energy
trader and Duke Energy Corp the largest USbased utility
holding company have said they would trade coal futures
     Exchange officials have said the coal market has the
potential to reach  trades a day after a year of trading
     The Nymexs yearold crude oil futures contract averages
about  trades a day and its yearold natural gas
contract averages about 

                           Wary of Coal

     The coal market is still lacking liquidity said Anthony
McAuley a floor broker at ABN Amro Inc who said he bought five
coal contracts for a client at  a ton  the markets first
transaction You probably need to see a little more
participation from industry coal buyers and sellers for the
market to take off
     Independent floor traders known as locals are wary of
trading coal futures without assurances that the industry will be
active as well
     Floor traders lost millions in electricity futures when
some were caught with highpriced contracts and nobody in the
industry to sell them to he said
     Because of that people are a little bit tentative about
coal said Tom Schiff an independent crude oil trader Were
here to help make liquidity but we cant tackle all the risk







			
			
		 Modern Metals July     Giant energy concern now turns its attention to steel The companys aggressive posture has begged controversy Industry reactions vary from handwringing to open arms Still others characterize Enron as a nonevent By Michelle Martinez Arjona EditorinChief and Paul Hohl Contributing Editor  These days saying the word Enron in a room full of metals executives is like screaming fire in a crowded theater For most in the steel industry the idea of a futures market is enough to raise a few eyebrows But when a major market maker with annual revenues of  times the market cap of the US steelmaking industry stakes a claim for  alone Enron logged revenues of  billionthats with a b a lot more than eyebrows are likely to be raised After a bold presentation from Jeff McMahon president and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets at the SSCI annual convention in May in which he accused steel mills of treating their service center customers as annoyances industry leaders rushed to understand this latest market contender  Friend or foe Competitor or partner These are just a couple of the questions surrounding Enrons aggressive push into the metals industry Judging from the service center and mill executives Modern Metals queried there are as many answers as there are opinions in the industry Reactions ranged from fear to acceptance to downright resentment At least one mill was reticent to discuss Enron at allstill others seemed to meet the issue with unaffected shrugs If the saying is true that all publicity is good publicity the buzz that Enron has generated would make even a Hollywood spin doctor envious Whats the hubbub Although products such as natural gas and energyEnrons major business platformhave been traded as commodities for years until Enrons appearance a formal forward market for steel has never existed According to McMahon the absence of a liquid and transparent market has resulted in uninformed investment decisions that have exacerbated the current oversupply situation and left companies exposed to the hazards of price volatility  Enrons answer is to offer a variety of financial hedging products along with forward contracts in hotrolled coldrolled and galvanized plate and long products are soon to follow locking in prices for as many as five years out Enron contends that it can act as a risk intermediary in steel transactions ensuring healthier profit margins and lowering the cost of capital Certain grades of steel are commodities McMahon insists and as such should be bought and sold on a commodity market basis instead of the strategic relationships that now exist between the mills and consumers Enron has been offering steel online and via phone and fax since November of last year Before you add capacity before you make an investment decision youll be able to see a three five maybe even a year forward price of steel McMahon stated and if you want to hedge that investment you can do that The company plans to buy steel at a floating price and then sell it to steel consumers at a fixed rate making money on the spread In February Greg Hermans VP of steel trading at Enron reported to AMM that it was offering USmade gauge in wide hotrolled for April delivery in Chicago for  a ton Hermans said Enron was buying the same product for April delivery at  a ton  Eventually Enron sees the development of four different marketplaces the Northeast the Midwest or Chicago area the Gulf Coast or Houston area and the West Coast Enron will hedge against spot price spikes through equity and physical holdings in domestic mills The company closed on Huntcos Arkansasbased coldrolling mill in June Its a big portfolio McMahon said We wanted to put together a portfolio of supply and demand In some cases well own assetshopefully well own some term contracts with domestic mills To the extent that imports are a part of the equation well be a part of that market We may purchase capacity from somebody not necessarily the assets but toll slab through a hot strip mill All of those combined is how we do our business Steel mills can benefit McMahon said by entering into a multiyear physical off take with Enron thus giving steel mills a degree of certain volume and on product specification Enron would guarantee purchase of a specified amount of tonnage and use a floating price or a floor price to guard against market shocks Whether mills would be willing to divert capacity to the commodity grades being bought and sold by Enron remains uncertain At least one mill executive privately said no    at least for now Nucor president CEO and vice chairman Dan DiMicco also sees little value in Enrons proposal What we need to have is stable pricing at levels where the most efficient mills can make a good return on their capital and further invest in new technologies and equipment he stated I define true value as helping the industry to become stronger It doesnt do any good to maintain a lack of price volatility at  a ton Keith Busse CEO at Steel Dynamics echoed that sentiment in a recent New Steel article If youre trying to get volatility out at  per ton great he said But at  you want to stick your fingers down your throat For the service centers Service centers McMahon suggested could benefit immediately The only way distributors are able to hedge themselves is to go out and buy inventory he explained That takes capital and cash and space We can offer a financial product that gives the exact same protection but doesnt require any of the above We can hold those inventories and price the steel at the time of delivery to the service centers he continued so their  or  percent net margins are somewhat certain I do think that Enron is providing a service for the industry     commented Dave Lerman CEO of Steel Warehouse South Bend Indiana But he pointed out that how it moves forward will be interesting If they just move forward with hedge instruments    thats independent of whether you run your business well by having a good supplier that matches up with the demands of your customers I think Enron will be a good thing for some people and a nonevent for others Beyond hedging McMahon pointed out firm and enforceable contracts could become a key benefit to service centers As one Midwestern distributor source commented One of the terrible things that happens in our business is that end users demand longterm pricing beyond what anybody can foresee When they anticipate the market is going up or that it has hit a low point they push harder for itas any one would But historically they dont honor the deals  In a down market he explained customers demand lower prices Noncompliance can result in orders but no releases and a dont call us well call you attitude from customers The consequence for service centers he said are price reductions on the way down and on the way up If Enron brings integrity to both sides of this market he concluded that would be a very big plus for the steel industry But integrity another Midwest service center exec countered has got nothing to do with it In his estimation Enron is like a profiteering carpetbagger trying to make a buck in between the producer and the user Thats all we need right now he declared somebody trying to squeeze out a few more dollars But he recognized were all going to have to deal with it Don McNeeley president and CEO of Chicago Tube  Iron indicated that some good could come of a heavyhitter like Enron introducing new ideas into the industry but acknowledged that people might be offended by somebody picking the socalled lowhanging fruit of the steel market in the current economy What do you think the mills are going to do when you come to them for just the peripheral items he queried My concern would be that the price would go up on those items McNeeley also questioned the wisdom of distributors relinquishing control of their inventories In distribution  percent of our net worth is inventory  percent is accounts receivable and  percent is plant property and equipment he related Our single largest asset is our inventory If a distribution company surrenders control of its inventory to a third party does not that distributor in effect surrender its own sovereignty Only just begun Questions abound regarding Enrons role as a physical supplier of steel as well As one Minnesotabased service center exec put it are they ready to deal with problems Although Enron has expressed interest in being a physical supplier Dave Lerman explained I think thats going to be a lot more difficult to implement Enron would have to consider specific qualities coil sizes nuances of chemistry surface quality and formability Most customers require better than standard tolerances he pointed out These are all issues that might complicate commodity sales Delivery is another issue As a physical supplier Enron has virtually guaranteed justintime delivery but as one service center source said the guarantee is good when the material shows up at my door What happens if it doesnt show up I disappoint a customer What good does it do to sue Enron if Ive lost a customer Mill executives have questioned whether Enron is a potential competitor They see Enron as someone likely to buy foreign steel in order to deliver it to a US customer said Chuck Bradford principal of Bradford Research and a longtime industry observer He cautioned against seeing Enron as too much of a physical supplier speculating that the future of Enron similar to the LME will be in hedging You may see some physical transactions to start with Bradford predicted just to get the ball rolling But I dont see that as the way the market will develop McMahon has been consistent in saying that Enron has little interest in becoming a steel manufacturer The real value he said is in a transparent liquid market We know the products work we know the market wants them Can any one particular mill or mills prevent that We dont think so he said Its not an if its a when The jury is still out on just how soon that when will come and what those effects will be for the steel industry And for all of the debate surrounding the issue it seems a bit soon to be hitting the panic button As Don McNeeley recounted I can recall similar controversy over a speech a guy gave about  years ago That guys name was Ken Iverson and he had this concept called a minimill Look at it now

Subject	Meeting with Dan Larcamp  Marketing Affiliate Rulemaking


Leslie Lawner Becky Cantrell and I met with Dan Larcamp at FERC yesterday to discuss the marketing affiliate issue  He agreed with the latest press reports that the upcoming rulemaking NOPR expected to be voted out in September would not make major structural changes to the industry  The current document is up to the Commission level and the Commissioners are clearly considering the alternatives now  Larcamp said he expected a broadening of the current market affiliate rules structure to include all corporate entities  He did specifically mention that the Commission is not comfortable with the link between financial and physical transactions and the possibility for manipulation of market prices in one market financial to affect prices in the other market physical  He also expects the Commission to blend the gas and power rules using the best practices of each  Any NOPR that is issued will of course have comment dates to allow Enron and all industry participants to comment on any proposed rule changes

Larcamp indicated that he did not think there were pervasive afilliate discrimination issues in the industry but said that the Commission needed to act due to the political pressures they got from the Hill etc  The El Paso case is top on everyones mind and is of special concern because it affects the California market both gas and power 

Larcamp indicated that he is just now learning what a Pat Wood Commission is going to want  He indicated that Wood has closer ties to the producer community than either of the two former Chairmen  He therefore expects  that the Commission will be responsive to that sector in taking a relook at the affiliate rules  However Larcamp did mention that the only meeting that he had previously had on the affiliate issue was with the INGAA group Joe Hartsoe went with them  It is not clear whether the producer community has lobbied this issue at the Commissioner level

We discussed strategy with Dan how to let the Commission feel more comfortable with the marketing affiliate issue  He suggested that he had gained a lot by visiting the trading floors including Enrons  He thought the Commissioners and their immediate staffs would benefit from similar visits  

We specifically raised the issue of market prices and talked about tranportation costs not equalling basis differentials  We stated that our marketers believed that the prices in the market were determined by market factors in the specific areas of delivery rather than basin costs plus transport costs  Dan did indicate some agreement with this concept and thought that more education at the Commissioner level would be very worthwhile

2001-07-09T12:56:00-07:00,"The letter looks good  A couple of comments for your consideration

On page three we describe the change to the definition of Public Utility and then argue that we dont fit into it  Would it be worth explaining why that makes sense  Specifically the New Jersey restructuring law like most efforts of its kind in other markets is designed to separate the competitive from monopoly elements of the power and gas businesses  Economic regulation would then be restricted to the remaining monopoly elements of the business eg distribution  The competitive market can not be solely relied upon to regulate the behavior of monopoly asset owners such as distribution utilities  Therefore regulators continue to be called upon to set pricing and other terms of service  What those regulators decide matters a great deal to those monopoly utilities and it consequently makes sense for lawmakers to be concerned about attempts by such entities to use campaign contributions to tacitly influence decision makers  The same public policies simply do not apply to that portion of the market which is competitive  The generation and sales business has a competitive structure ie relatively low barriers to entry multiple competitors etc  These components of the power and gas business can be regulated by the market with respect to rates and terms of service  They do not require economic regulation any more than grocery stores department stores appliance sellers or other retailers who presumably are not prohibited from making contributions  Competition and markets discipline behavior and establish competitive prices and terms of service  Because regulators dont set the prices and terms of service for such sellers there is no reason to be concerned about campaign contribuitions from such organizations  Indeed the legislation and the legislative history clearly conform to this underlying policy rationale
As a former practicing lawyer I certainly understand the value of pleading in the alternative  But I question how certain of our arguments woud be perceived by the public if they ever came to light which these documents have a habit of doing   I can just see the press seizing on Enrons claim of ignorance or mistake or the fact that we pled for the favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion  I suggest that we add whatever we feel is necessary to the very solid looking intent argument not make specific reference to ignorance or mistake and not plead for the favorable esxercise of PD  If we feel we need to write about this last item perhaps we could suggest that it would be a waste of the publics resources to pursue a claim under such circumstances"

Subject	Transatlantic meetings

To the Executive Committee

Attached is a note that has been sent to our managers regarding offsite and teambuilding meetings  My impression is that our commendable efforts to build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many gettogethers that require substantial travel  Our challenge is that such gatherings are far more costly and timeconsuming for us to attend than our Houston colleagues might realize  Often participating in these meetings takes an entire week for Enron Europe employees especially if they are outside of Texas Naturally they may feel that this time of year PRC time is exactly the wrong time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering

These offsites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter which compounds the difficulty worse still are the times they occur at the end of Q since it also coincides and conflicts with the PRC process

I would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the travel time and costs both direct and indirect when inviting international employees to offsite meetings in the US  We appreciate the chance to be included in the broader Enron initiatives and to share ideas across organizations but we are really trying to reinforce the message about managing expenses

Thanks

John Sherriff


Letter sent to all Enron Europe VPs and direct reports

We still have issues regarding Offsites and Team Building exercises  In particular we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform other key work groups when workplace absences are pending

In order to avoid misunderstandings and to increase transparency the following will apply with immediate effect

Any Offsite or Team Building exercise which any group both commercial and noncommercial and including John and myselfintends to undertake must be communicated in advance to all department heads Issue to be identified include  all participants who will out of the office total costs of the exercise and where appropriate work load coverage details

John and I are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefer that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends To the extent that is not possible we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work is appropriately covered

Trips to Houston and especially resorts in the US are far more difficult to justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved  So please pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel

Please communicate this policy to your staff

Federal price limits backfire 
Some generators withhold power rather than abide by rate caps 
David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer 
Wednesday July   
 San Francisco Chronicle  
URL http  wwwsfgatecom cgibin articlecgifile chronicle archive    MNDTL  
Officials in California and Nevada after months of lobbying for federal regulators to cap Western power prices warned yesterday that the newly imposed limits have had the unintended consequence of increasing a threat of blackouts in the two states 
The warnings were issued as California came within minutes of rolling blackouts yesterday afternoon and one day after the firstever rolling blackouts in Las Vegas forced energyhungry casinos to shut off fountains and reduce air conditioning 
The two states are asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take a closer look at the socalled price mitigation plan and come up with revisions that would deter power companies from withholding electricity during shortages 
We need some clarity to this order said Oscar Hidalgo a spokesman for the California Department of Water Resources which is spending billions of dollars to keep the states lights on 
Generators need to be held accountable he said 
The crux of the problem is that price limits kick in during shortages yet power companies say these caps force them to sell power at belowmarket rates during periods of high demand 
Some companies have responded by holding back power rather than face the expense of shipping electricity from state to state Each mile that electricity must be transmitted adds to the overall cost 
No ones going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps said Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum an energyindustry association in Menlo Park 
Ackerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was no economic advantage to offering power in regional markets when price controls are in effect 
This means individual regions like California or Las Vegas could end up not having enough Ackerman said It increases the threat of blackouts 
BLACKOUT ALERT CANCELED
California authorities issued a blackout alert at  pm yesterday when power reserves dipped to dangerously low levels They canceled the alert about an hour later after finding additional supplies 
Everyone in the West is fighting for megawatts said Stephanie McCorkle a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator which oversees the states power network 
The Golden States latest brush with lightsout conditions came a day after Nevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time prompting heavy power users such as the MGM Grand and Caesars Palace to dim their lights 
Don Soderberg chairman of the Nevada Public Utilities Commission said that the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that they are investigating to see what role the federal price limits may have had in exacerbating Mondays shortage 
Were looking very closely at this he said There seems to be a potential for unintended consequences 
Specifically Soderberg said Nevada is focusing on operators of older less efficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking if not vanishing under capped prices 
Were going to see how the caps might have played into this he said 
The federal ceiling in  Western states excluding California is about  per megawatt hour In California a  percent surcharge is added because of the states credit risk bringing the price to just over  
Ackerman at the Western Power Trading Forum said regional price controls have extended Californias power crisis to neighboring states 
California sneezed and the rest of the region caught the virus he said 
LAWYERS LOOKING FOR LOOPHOLES 
California and Nevada officials however said that they still have faith that price limits can stabilize Western electricity markets but that federal regulators may have to tweak the system so that power companies cannot withhold output 
The generators have banks of lawyers looking for loopholes in the plan said Hidalgo at the Department of Water Resources 
Unfortunately it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue that they took up only with the greatest reluctance For months federal regulators refused to impose price controls preferring instead to let supply and demand determine costs 
Hidalgo said that when it appeared that power companies were throttling back on output Monday California officials immediately dialed the hot line number provided by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in case of emergencies 
No one answered he said They were closed 
State officials tried again yesterday and this time were told that the commission would look into the matter They were not given a time frame for when the commission might come up with a response

Outofstate generators pull plug over uncertainty on price controls
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
Published July   
Confused by the federal governments new controls on electricity prices generators withheld so much power from California on Monday that the state was nearly plunged into rolling blackouts state officials said 
The confusion began when the states electric grid operators declared a Stage  power alert in the early afternoon triggering the price caps for the first time since they went into effect June  
Outofstate generators pulled about  megawatts of electricity off the table at midafternoon enough to power about  million homes because of uncertainty about how much they could charge under the new Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pricing system said Oscar Hidalgo spokesperson for the state Department of Water Resources The department buys electricity for the states financially distressed utilities 
They didnt understand what they were going to be paid there was confusion over the FERC order Hidalgo said We saw  megawatts disappear 
The problem was exacerbated by a heat wave across the West which forced California to compete with other states for scarce electricity he said Rolling blackouts hit southern Nevada 
Most California officials credit the FERC system which is based on a variable price cap with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power market But power generators have complained that the price caps by limiting profits could discourage the production of critically needed electricity And as Mondays episode suggested even the uncertainty about where the cap will fall could lead to unexpected shortages 
Thats the risk that you run with price controls said Arthur ODonnell editor of the newsletter California Energy Markets People want any kind of certainty at all 
Hidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of lastminute imports from the Bonneville Power Administration the federal agency that markets governmentproduced hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest The state went into a Stage  power alert the nexttolast level before blackouts are ordered The alert was canceled in late afternoon 
The blackouts would have been the first in California since May  
FERC imposed a roundtheclock ceiling on power throughout the West The price fluctuates and is tied to the production costs of the leastefficient plant operating in California during a power alert declared by the Independent System Operator which runs the states powertransmission grid When theres no alert prices cant exceed  percent of the cap that was established during the latest alert 
Until Monday the maximum price held steady at about  a megawatthour in California But when the ISO declared a Stage  power alert in early afternoon signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than  percent of demand confusion set in Hidalgo and others said 
Because of a steep drop in the price of natural gas which fuels many California power plants suppliers knew the cap would fall But no one knew by how much until the price was posted by the ISO 
The ceiling for California fell to about  at  pm but was back up to  in two hours according to the ISO Those prices include the  percent premium that sellers can charge California because FERC said theres a credit risk in selling to the state 
ODonnell said its likely suppliers will pull back from the market every time the ISO declares a power alert 
Instate generators have to operate their plants if summoned by the ISO But outofstate suppliers can withhold supplies and on Monday it was the outofstaters that were pulling back Hidalgo said

Power Sales Halted by New Pricing Curbs 
Electricity Confused suppliers unsure what they will be paid refuse to sell to state which asks FERC for a ruling but doesnt get it 

By NANCY VOGEL Times Staff Writer 

     SACRAMENTOConfusion over new federal price restrictions prompted several electricity sellers to back away from sales to California on Monday afternoon pushing the state closer to blackouts energy officials said
     The state lost sales that would have provided enough electricity to supply more than  million homes said Ray Hart deputy director of the California Department of Water Resources which has been buying much of the states electricity since January
     At least five companies producing or marketing power are telling us that since they dont know what theyre going to get paid theyre not going to take the risk and so theyre not going to sell the energy Hart said
     The electricity sales fell through after power consumption soared in summer heat and grid operators were forced to declare a Stage  emergency meaning reserves had dipped below  It was the first such emergency since May 
     Under a June  order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission intended to bring down wholesale electricity markets across the West a power emergency in California triggers the setting of a new price limit that applies to power plant owners from Washington to Arizona 
     The new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run the most inefficient expensive power plant selling electricity to California grid operators during the first full hour of a Stage  emergency
     But much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price is supposed to be established under the commissions order and that apparently drove away sellers Hart said
     Shortly after the state issued the Stage  alert at  pm putting the old price limit of  per megawatthour in question companies that had committed to provide the state electricity hour by hour Monday afternoon backed out Hart said The companies include TransAlta Energy Marketing of Oregon Constellation Power of Baltimore and Sempra Energy Trading a unit of the San Diegobased energy conglomerate
     Forced to dip even deeper into the states power reserves and declare a Stage  emergency water agency officials called the federal energy commissions hotline for clarification about what the new price should be and when it should take effect They got no answer
     Hart said commission officials reached at home promised to try to clarify their order today One outstanding question is what obligations power suppliers have to deliver electricity to California in an emergency
     Both buyers and sellers in the market agree that the new price when it is set will probably be lower than  per megawatthour because the price of natural gas the main fuel in California power plants has dropped lately
     Temperatures soared several degrees higher Monday than grid operators had anticipated But they said they expected to avoid rolling blackouts in part because the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland Ore had agreed to provide several hundred megawatts of Pacific Northwest hydropower each hour in exchange for a return of electricity from California later this summer
     Bonneville is giving us emergency power to get us through Hart said

	Subject            pm  Update Emergency 

	The situation continues to be stable  CLHB has reinitated LPG operations to LaPaz but continue their inspection  TR will not reinitiate gas or crude export operations until we have completed our inspection  We have formed joint teams with CLHB and Army personnel to perform the inspection  It could take as long as  hours but well have a better estimate after we get a progress report in the morning   All crews available systemwide are mobilizing for inspection of the entire system but for now our priority continues to be the lines in the altiplano  The three stations in the altiplano have been shut down bled off and locked  Other supervisors throughout the system have been advised and are on alert

	Government and regulator continue to be supportive of our shutdown and inspection action plan  We have developed a contingency plan with COBEE the regional electricity distributor under which they will redistribute energy out of spare capacity in Cochabamba to LaPaz   this should cover LaPazs electricity needs during the duration of time we need to complete our inspection  The only other significant consumer is a large cement plant in LaPaz  Weve agreed that they will slow down their operations and provide only small local supplies industrial concrete demand will be shutin

	We did not send a press release on the issue although we have received inquiries  our response is that we are concerned about the risk to Bolivians this action presented and we are performing an inspection on the system  We are avoiding mention of gas stoppage to LaPaz at this time due to the volatility of the issue in LaPaz  Government VMEH SIRESE has agreed with the message

	We expect that with the cement plant and power plant offline line pack should be sufficient to keep commercial demand satisfied for a few days  In either event we are working with the local gas distributor to prepare a notice for LaPaz newspapers instructing gas consumers in the area how to safely shutdown and restart their equipment in the event that it becomes necessary

	The most likely scenario as of now is that Edwin Morales  a local revolutionary tied to the coca trade  is behind the action  Morales has had contact in the past with the Raul Rocha bunch out of Chuquina Oruro so were still not sure whether this was an act against TR and or the industry or if it is against government  Morales has just joined forces with another rebel out of Cochabamba and is planning nationwide road blocks for tomorrow  Their agenda is national  theyve never isolated TR or our industry as a whole although Chaco in the north have been targeted in the past probably because they have a field in the middle of Morales stronghold  The political situation here is tenuous with Banzer out and various political interests looking to fill the leadership void  Were watching this situation closely  The local Army brigade has committed to staying on vigilance for at least the next few days  once were comfortable with the operational situation well discuss a longerterm solution

	At  pm today a CLHB line walker discovered a bomb on their LPG line in the Altiplano  km from out SicaSica station  Our OSSA II crude exports to Chile and GAA gas to LaPaz share the same ROW and would likely have been taken out with the bomb  We understand that the bomb which had a manual fuse did not go off but had been lit and failed to explode  The Army has been mobilized to diffuse the bomb and we consider the immediate threat neutralized

	However given that we have now seen several attempts in the last  days of sabotage against our lines I have declared a state of EMERGENCY and will notify the Enron Crisis team

	We have shut all Altiplano pipeline operations down and have mobilized a joint CLHB TR Army team to perform vigilance on the entire altiplano network  The immediate result of this is that lights will likely start to go out in LaPaz within the next few hours  the GAA line is their primary power fuel supply  Ive notified all relevant government authorities of the situation and so far am getting support  Ive also asked the Embassy to look into the situation with the understanding that if this is the result of an organized movement they might have access to intelligence that could be helpful

	Additionally weve shut down all noncritical maintenance operations throughtout the rest of the system and are directing spare personnel to perform vigilance on the remainder of the system as quickly as possible  Until and unless we have information that this threat goes beyond the altiplano we will continue operations with all stations on alert  We will kick off the the total system inspection within the next few hours as soon as our people complete the overall plan

	I will keep you posted as things develop

Good news  As you indicated would happen Kalen Pieper called me midweek  We had a very good conversation about EES and Dave Delaineys leadership  She explored my views about doing business with government  Shortly thereafter Daves office called to invite me to Houston on Thursday July   
 
Kay Chapman explained that Daves schedule would keep him out of pocket until August   In order to move forward Janet Dietrich will be meeting with me when I go to Houston next Thursday  I must confess that after all the great things I have heard about the man I do look forward to meeting Dave himself
 
Is there a time next week that I can speak with you by phone to finetune my thinking   preparation for Thursdays meeting with Janet

I have pulled the information that you requested and the attached document outlines the findings  Per your request the data compiled is a sampling of soft money donations for the  cycle for the Energy Financial and Pharmaceutical industries  This was ready for you last night but I decided to dig a little deeper and have provided additional data that you may find useful

I looked at the specific industry for the companies that you requested and then I backed up to the Overview for the industry

In The Center for Responsive Politics website the Top Recipients are based on contributions from PACs soft money donors and individuals giving  or more Due to the voluminous nature of the Top Recipients listed I printed them out and they are available for your perusal  On the spreadsheet I continued the analysis on the Top Recipients and what was donated in the election cycles    across the  industries   Because you asked for a combination of Oil  Gas Companies and Electric Utilities I showed Electric Utilities and Oil  Gas data separately and then combined  

Numbers that are listed in bold indicate the group who had the largest donations within each research area  The split on the Top Presidential Democrat and Republican Candidates are calculated from the Overview of Sectors

Im not sure of the context of your Email to Ken but I wanted to emphasize one point on the data youve put together   The Center for Responsible Politics numbers include individual contributions  Thus if you look at Enrons socalled split under their analysis Enron splits its  much for favorably for Republicans than in the numbers underpinning the pie charts contained in the material I distributed  Unlike the Centers numbers my charts do not reflect giving by individuals working at Enron  Most of our individual  which is significant is given to Republicans  Consequently as I understand the history of our giving part of our thinking on splitting soft  is to offset the overwhelming individual  given to Republicans   One last thought is that I understand the split recommended in our proposed budget  is much more Republican than it has been in past years  Hope this helps

Subject	Pending Refund Order Discussed at Todays Commission Meeting

Although a final order is not yet available we were able to glean the basic content of the Commissions latest refund order from the discussion had at the Commission meeting this morning   It appears that the Commission has not strayed far from Judge Wagners recommendations which came out of the settlement conference ordered by FERC  Highlights include

In California refunds offsets apply only to spot transactions in CAISO and CalPX and only as of October 

Both public and nonpublic utilities are subject to refund

It appears that the refund methodology will be similar to that of the June  Order as refined by Judge Wagner

Daily spot gas prices will be utilized in the methodology

A  creditworthiness premium will be added

An evidentiary hearing will be ordered to collect the data needed for the methodology  it is our understanding that the CAISO will have  days to provide certain information and the Judge must certify the record in  days

A separate preliminary evidentiary hearing will be ordered to consider Pacific Northwest refunds  It was briefly described as consisting of an information gathering proceeding of  days followed by an evidentiary proceeding of  days  The Judge would then have an additional  days to report to the Commission  An issue will be the definition of spot transaction for the Pac NW since counsel to the Commission noted that it could differ from the spot definition for California


We are awaiting the final order and will update this report as soon as it issues

Steve Did you get my earlier email re this last week

Ken


I found out at a meeting last Wednesday from an employee of another department that my title had changed from Manager to Sr Specialist in the Expertfinder I returned to the office and found this to be true I called Joann Hill in Corporate HR and met with her on Friday She advised me that there had been a study which reclassified several of us on EPSC We were not informed prior to this happening I was further frustrated because when I was transitioned to this department in April  I met with Bill Donovan and Lou Casari and was told that nothing would change about my title or responsibilities EBS would be my primary client and I would be charged back  When I was transferred my team was assigned to managers already in the department I was not told that my title was in jeopardy I am still responsible for Julie Stockham as a report in Portland although she is in Phillip Lord s cost center Joann was very gracious and agreed to investigate and let me know

This is a setback I had not anticipated especially after John Echols ad advised me I was next for promotion

Enron has been named most innovative company for six consecutive years by Fortune magazine  However this year has been challenging for the company  External market issues and internal restructurings have resulted in a depressed stock price and low moral among employees  

Your insights on creating a motivating work environment and stimulating innovation would be especially interesting at this years conference  If you are interested in presenting to our group Id like to explore your availability the morning of Friday November 

Please feel free to respond to my email or call me at   I look forward to hearing from you

Steve you may be aware that we are featuring an article on the PRC process in the Enron Business that were editing now The issue is due to be published in two weeks

Karen has made her comments on the story Id appreciate hearing what you have to say

I havent reviewed the story yet with HR David Oxley is my contactIve made sure that the story is balanced accurate and fair My fear is that HR will not want us to publish any negative comments on the process If so I think they would be overlooking an effective and credible method of communicating why the PRC process is so important to how Enron does business 

Sarah has already discussed with Beth Tilney that we will publish another article in the next issue when the Culture Committees recommendations on PRC are fully developed and ready to be implemented 

We are working on a tight deadline and I suspect the  review process will be lengthy I hope you can return it sometime Monday

Steve the comment compilation is a laundry list  I think that some of them are completely out of sync and unjustified but others are real and many repeat themselves  Many of the comments are with respect to salary  There is also the theory that only the unhappy or bitter or unsuccessful take the time to answer  The happy ones might just have passed on this one

	Regardless of whether you like your rotation or not the Program itself is staffed in a very amateur manner  There are a few really good people but for the most part it is just not professionally run  Calls unanswered lots of passing the buck and general disorganization

	If they have resources they do a poor job of communicating them  While we do have a responsibility to find info ourselves there should be an active effort to point us to those resources

	Compensation  The bonus part is certainly not communicated as being locked into a fixed range and independent of business unit performance  At the very least this is a serious oversight  

	PRC  Really doesnt work  Not an apple to apples comparison  Heavily dependent on when where you rotated

	I could care less about Enrons reputation  I tried paying my student loans with reputation but they only accepted cash  How much money can I make at this place assuming the stock price doesnt double every few months in effect preventing Enron from getting the public equity markets to pay my compensation  

	Also there has been a significant change on the acceptable cut in terms of the PRC where before Enron was penalizing the have issues classification of the PRC now it feels like they are trying to get rid of  of the pool Reinforcing the first paragraph

	Offer of salary is cloaked and we dont know where we can end up

	I believe there is a big disconnect between recruiting team and the head office As a result the sales pitch given to recruits leads to false expectations And obviously when those expectations are not met we all know the consequences

	The rest of the downtown Houston Energy concerns are paying much higher base

	Can we have a list of companies we benchmark compensation against  Is it really Wall Street and consulting  If so Id like to see the names of the firms  New York is not that expensive that the well theyre in New York excuse covers all discrepancies  It feels like we must be benchmarking against second or third tier MBA recruiters

	Theres a feeling among the Associate pool that you need to be in a secure established money making division in order to guarantee a average or above PRC for the end of the year and therefore not be in the two bottom brackets and not be fired  That goes against the long term reputation of Enron as a company where you are rewarded for taking risks 

	Attempting to get into rotation and expect competition from others rotating but do not expect to get displaced by a st rotation associate that is placed by the AA pool

	Assignment of st rotation was chosen for me and the job function was more of an analyst function than it was an associate function  Why cant alumni from your school help to find a rotation to match the desires of the in coming candidate

	Manage expectationsdont need to hear about  year old trader and Louise Kitchens rise to fame with Enron Onlinecreates an expectation that those are more common occurrences than they really are

	It doesnt feel like theres a lot to do in all areas nonetheless something between  and  new associates coming in these fall First why that many  Second do they know what they are getting into

	The main issues have to do with compensation being well below market  we have always been assured that the bonus and options more than made up for the disparity but given the declining stock value lack of meaningful rotations and decrease in the overall level of satisfaction with the program this is becoming a much bigger issue

	Enron is so secretive about salaries that Associates have no idea what the upside looks like  Working for beans in year  is ok if years  are excellent  We really have no idea what to expect for salary or bonus after the program is over

	Salary well below market base salary and value of options bonus  even if they bring us up to the  offers which are rumored to be under market we have  year or more experience with the class coming in and will be paid the same amount

	Lack of quality rotations cuts in EBS EES ect

	Level of responsibility is well below expectations maturity level

	Compensation for Associates is at the bottom of the pay scale for Top BSchools  Not only in comparison to IB and Consulting but also compared to specialties brand management etc that are at the lower end of the MBA scale  It is cheaper to live in Houston but our student loans are not indexed by location  Other energy companies here in town even pay more  

	The Enron contract is designed to retain employees with sticks and not carrots  There is no other company I know that expects full repayment of a signing bonus  months after the start date  If the Program is truly special people should not be forced to repay anythingEnron should deliver what they advertise and people will stay  The month lock up period suggests a concern with retention that is being met with a penalty to the Associate and not an improvement in the Program 

	How much do managers make assuming certain business and individual performance levels  Ive got no clue but Im wondering why it such a big secret 

	The PRC process does not encourage people to experiment in their rotations as Enron implies  For example if you take a rotation in an area you know nothing about you will lose in the PRC because you are still learning the job  Similarly if you were a trader and go to a trading rotation you will be rewarded a PRC time

	There are too many associates and too few analysts   Too many associate rotations become exercises in finding something to do  Too often associates think to themselves I remember doing this several years ago as an undergrad why am I doing this again

	They should present the program for what it is an internal labor pool where Associates find their own rotations depending on what is available and who they know  The Program does not match people with jobs and should make it clear that you will be interviewing for jobs etc upon entry into the program  This is not because they want Associates to have choice but rather because they have no proven record of placing people in the rotations  

	If we are not going to be competitive with Wall Street and consulting we should at least be competitive with our energy competitors  I dont know what companies we are benchmarking against but I guarantee we are not keeping up  Small differences can create a lot animosity towards the program  When a person who didnt get into Enron but got into a competitor makes materially more money from the start people start believing they have just been sold a lot of hype

	Not enough development during rotations  even associates who end up learning a lot dont necessarily enjoy their rotations because they dont feel part of the team

	Not getting to pick your rotations or at least interview for your first rotation is a moral buster as well  Additionally it can waste a lot of time in the case that someone is forced into a group or position they have no interest in

	Compensation  many gave up lucrative offers elsewhere for a lower base and bonus package from Enron because the stock price movement promised large equity based compensation  Also it was very difficult to find out what full first year bonuses were during the recruiting process  Most wrongly believed that this indicated that the bonuses were competitive versus other leading MBA avenues  How much money do people at Enron make assuming the stock price performs Great  Okay  Poor  

	Responsibility  when you are getting recruited you always here the Louise Kitchen John Arnold and Greg Whalley examples as if that is normal  We need to stop doing that  Enrons slowing growth rate and failure in everything outside of gas and power trading will super fast promotions as we look more and more like a large corporation  

	The program is designed to bring in too many associates and then let them compete with each other until the weaker associates are driven out  If this is true why not spend more time and money recruiting and bring in fewer higher quality associates from the start  the process of weeding out leaves everyone with a bad feeling  More importantly you probably lose more good people then you realize

	Trading trading trading  On MBA campus visits Enron gives the impression that there are lots of corporate development  MA finance and other similar assignments available at Enron  The reality seems that if you are not interested in trading for a living you are not on the companys main commercial track any longer

	Finding a Rotation Information difficult to get it is all networking This is fine but I dont consider the A A progrram a resource in this area at all If no one else does we should cut any expenses they are incurring for rotation placement

	The skew on associate bonuses hurts morale  You can reward the high performers without penalizing the good performers  Recently the word has gotten around 	that the top  and the next  of the PRC group got very large bonuses while everyone below that level got very poor bonuses  This distribution creates a small number of very happy people and a larger number of unhappy people

	I find it interesting that Enron chooses to  adopt a business model based upon freemarket economics and  pride itself on its intellectual capital in an era in which the company moves toward being a financial services player rather than a firm with a tremendous physical presence  In selecting an employer this was a HUGE selling point  I find it paradoxical however that we have chosen to adopt a pay grade that could at best be described as socialistic and below market  In a labor market where intellectual capital is portable and our chief competitors have seen our competitive advantage in the form of this asset I can only believe that Enron is positioning itself to fall short in the years to come when J Aron Morgan Stanley Dynegy El Paso etc decide that the cheapest way to gain ground on Enron is to higher this intellectual capital  Without griping I feel if nothing else workers at Enron would like to be paid market rate for the talents we possess  In our sales pitch we are told that Enron benchmarks pay against our energy competitors as well as comparable jobs on Wall Street  I can say from experience that our compensation packages cannot hold a candle to the potential for a Wall Street style pay package which leaves me bitter that the sales pitch was shallow fell short or was deliberately misguided  Part of the problem from an Associates perspective stems from Enron promising the moon and then falling short on delivery  Like a company that fails to deliver on earnings in a tough market punishment for such a shortfall is swift and severe  I truly believe Enron is setting itself up for such a fall unless this matter is addressed swiftly

	In an extension of the contradiction between free market economics and socialistic patronage I have come to notice that more and more departments are positioning themselves to hire Associates under the guise that the Associate promise to stay more than the required and desired six months  Further many desks once happy with the performance of the Associate ask for the option to retain the Associate  However no effort is made to compensate the Associate for essentially giving up the optionality embedded in a rotational program  In fact many choosing to stay within a group have made their experiences explicitly known to others that come PRC time they have actually been slighted for cutting short their rotation and instead opting to join a unit full time  By removing the ability of business units to promote a worker until conclusion of the  month period hard working goodfit Associates miss the opportunity to capitalize on what would seem to be a natural fit for a fulltime position and the chance to alleviate a significant source of discontentCOMPENSATION which could be addressed through the immediate promotion to the Manager level  By allowing for promotion Associates could earn enhanced compensation and department heads could address hiring needs  Rather Associates leave a unit disgruntled feeling they are marking time in other units potentially passing up an alternative that may be of great interest  Additionally a number of Commercial units have even gone so far as refusing to hire Associates unless they are in their third or fourth rotation so as to retain a call option on an employee that has run out of rotation alternatives  This practice CANNOT be in the best interest of the Desks the Program or for that matter Enron  By pigeonholing employees in this matter the significance and importance of rotations is greatly diminished as is our work experience  This is just ludicrous  Department heads arent looking to hire externally because of the salary shortfall and our forced pay grade  Rather they are trying to plug a Manager level position with an Associate salary  Again rather than pay a competitive performancebased wage Enron has adopted a tightfisted socialistic pay grade to better serve expenses  Ultimately this will lead to people seeking to rotate out of Enron for the compensation the market will bare   

	I think A A provides an excellent opportunity to find the department that you would like to work in through rotations and if you do a good job chances of advancing are much better for analysts and associates than for regular employees

	We get solid commercial responsibility from the get go  I doubt many of the guys who went to NY had this

	We get lots of freedom to manage my own business as long as I produce

	Salaries Not in line with market

	Mentors Not encouraged throughout the organization 

	Recruiting Disorganized not enough student focus trying to compete with the IBanks but not willing to offer the salaries sometimes unprofessional conduct rejection letters to students contained spelling errors and gave message you are not good enough

	Summer Intern Program Not well coordinated 

	Rotation Length Keep flexibility  mos sometimes too short other times too long disincents management to include Associates in longer term meatier projects

	When is the issue of salary increases going to be revisited

	Overall Enron has a great group of people to work with

	Enron has an excellent diversity of backgrounds ethnicity and nationalities within the company

	Enron has an excellent overall atmosphere

	Overall Enron has an excellent overall company image

	I do not have too many comments My main problem with the last team was that they were extremely rigid  rigid start date rigidity in assigning groups etc Old group did oneway dialogues they would not even listen The new group appears flexible and is willing to listen  these are two things I feel are most important in running such program

	Three months ago I talked with Althea Gordon about a couple of friends that graduated with me from my business school  They wanted still want to work for Enron I sent her their resumes and am still waiting for a response I believe she left Enron I then contacted Patricia Payton Several emails phone calls and still havent heard from her Its frustrating dealing with the HR dept

	PRC is not a trusted mechanism  Few people in the program understand it fully no one knows exactly what occurs in the meetings and no one believes the results are truly equitable  Politics appears to play as much of a role as performance if not more so in determining rankings  Further groups are not obligated to tell people in the pool where they ultimately ranked people  For as much as individuals success depends upon this ranking and for as open and honest as the process is supposed to be that policy is incredibly inconsistent

	We are under market for compensation  everyone knows this regardless of what the program people say  It is common knowledge that at least Reliant and El Paso are paying their program participants more in salary and bonus  The decision to increase sign on bonuses and not salaries to incoming participants slighted existing program members by keeping our salaries flat and was not well received obviously

	Rotation placement service is not very useful  The best way to find a good rotation remains through networking

	The experience talent and character of the associate pool continue to be excellent

	Cooperation and support within the associate class is very good with virtually no known instances of undermining or backstabbing  Comeraderie among the class is widespread and genuine

	The efforts to solicit feedback and foster communication by the new A A program administration is appreciated and a positive step in the right direction


	Historically there has been at best a poor effort to both maintain internal communication and networking within each associate class and to create new networks between individual associate classes  Efforts by individual associates to affect this have not been supported

	Mixers with business unit management should be continuously offered particularly as rotation time approaches  This would facilitate informal discussion about opportunities and business unit activity  Additionally it would be a good format for associates to exchange information on their rotations and introduce those interested to potential future managers

	Compensation is clearly an issue  Whether the compensation gap exists in reality or it only exists in perception there is a widespread belief that Enron is undercompensating associates relative to both other firms in the industry and to a broader set of companies where the same skill sets are employed  This is exasperated by the collapsing stock price and severely underwater options  Base salary should be addressed

	Again whether perception or reality associates are concerned about selecting rotations in groups that are not making money  The belief is that bonus levels rise and fall with the profitability of business units  Therefore it is an extreme disincentive to rotate through an unprofitable group regardless of the skill development it may offer

	The mandatory eighteenmonth service period before eligibility for promotion is arbitrary and penalizes the best performers

	What happened to the A A publication

	There is no source available that provides a history of individual associates who have rotated through specific jobs  It would be very beneficial to have a directory of associates who could be contacted for firsthand information on business units of interest

	My assessment of the program thus far is that I think there are a lot of instances where the interviewing group is not upfront about the responsibilities that they plan to assign to the Associates before they get into the group  Once in I know of several people including myself that get a whole lot of very ridiculous work that was not a part of the set expectations prior to joining that group  Furthermore I believe that Associates get work that is more suitable for a clerk than for someone with a graduate degree  This is very frustrating because once your in your in and you cant get out for  months  On top of that you get PRC reviews based on work that was not challenging and I do not believe that a fair and equitable assessment can be made  

	Now I understand that this line of thinking does not apply to everyone  But the point is that much of this would never happen if people were upfront with their expectations prior to hiring on an Associate  In addition it bothers me that Associates are many times treated very very poorly by their new groups  This has not been the case for me but I know people that have voiced these thoughts and opinions  so I am speaking for them incase they are too nervous to put it into writing

	That is about it  I would like to see some education come out of the Associate Program as to new groups that start within Enron as well as some greater insight to particular groups and the expectations

	When Enron recruited us it was so different from what it is now  So many diverse opportunities were out there  Now Enron is heading towards a pure trading house  It is getting harder and harder to get a decent rotation out of trading  But you dont need an MBA to be a trader  In fact Associates often work for analysts on the trading side and we dont have any special attention or cultivation from management to progress on the trading side  It is not a surprise some of us are thinking about getting the next rotation at El Paso

	A lot of business units think Associates come and go too quickly and six months is not enough for us to climb up the learning curve first and then make meaningful contributions  Some people think it is worthwhile to groom Associates even less worthwhile than to cultivate Analysts who are supposed to be there longer  It is sometimes difficult for Associates to get meaningful assignments if management holds such a perception against us

	Compensation level needs to be adjusted to match up with our competitors

	The companys direction has changed drastically from the one I interviewed for in November  some of these strategies seem shortsighted and in my opinion could make it more difficult for the company to compete in the energy business in the long term specifically

	The stated strategy of exiting all generation exploration and transportation assets in my mind endangers the competitive position of the company and earns us a banking multiple on the street  Also with additional players entering the gas and power markets in a major way how can we expect to continue to grow and maintain our current market share

	Along with our success there have been many failed business ventures including Azurix Enron International Dabhol EBS and EES  The failures of EES and EBS have still not been fully resolved and appear to have not been totally priced in to our stock price  Bottom line there does not appear to be any large areas of growth within the company

	Pay When the firms right up the street offers you anywhere from  to  dollars more to do the same job it doesnt make you feel very intelligent to be working here  Additionally when I accepted this position I was never told and have yet to be told what the official limits on and what the determinants are of the annual bonus  What I have heard through the grapevine is that it is significantly lower than what I was led to believe during recruiting  Not having any assistance and having attended a top East coast school I am almost  dollars in debt  I was counting on the annual bonus to allow me to remove this albatross from around my neck but in reality after my debt service I am barely better off than when I worked as an engineer in manufacturing

	I dont see much difference in the kind of assignments between Analysts and Associates It seems unfair for Analysts since they get lower salaries but it is also a waste of years of experience in the case of Associates  It is probably the number of Associates hired every year through the Program gives the idea of a cheap resource for the business units Be certain the position requires some degree of expertise before assigning an Associate

	If you look at A A as human capital we at Enron are very long in background experience and knowledge The A A Program is Regulation using Enron terminology from rotation assignments to payments I see pretty logical the consequences a lot of inefficiencies waste of energy the lack of objectivity poor motivation or even frustration in general performance is far away from excellent Add some flexibility to the Program let the people choose their rotations and move without restrictions Let them also negotiate working conditions salaries and career path with the business unit

	PRC is unfair I consider offensive writing in a maximum of  lines  months of accomplishments I dont think a PRC Committee can better assess the performance than the business unit degree evaluations and peers review are ok  Rethink the need of a committee and a ranking of A A assigned to so different business units

	I feel free to choose for a second rotation I like the way you can approach a new business unit introduce yourself have an interview and gathered information about the business and your position Things may change after that and you get stacked in that place for at least  months Keep allowing people to search and move freely from HR


	Make staff more accountable  Online based  Much like the IT department where when I call it initiates a request that I must approval closure of with any comments

	Tell people up front that bonuses are pretty fixed until you make Manager  Not communicated at all

	Tell people that their first rotations are assigned  Also not communicated

	I wish I had a PRC suggestion but I need to think about it

	Dont insult my intelligence by giving incoming Associates more money but putting it in a bonus so you dont have to give us raises  If you want to do that give me the courtesy of being up front about it

	Some kind of database maybe there is one that I dont know about of openings  Would be pretty cool

	Raise compensation so it is at a premium to our competitors  at the least so it is equal

	Make the development and support of associates a more important criterion in the PRC process for both directors and Vice Presidents  The commercial stress is so high right now that development is ignored completely

	Reduce the size of each incoming class  make the program special again  Right now I cant believe the broad spread in ability and experience in the associate class  I guarantee the spread is not that high in other top tier firms that hire MBAs

	With the smaller size assign a lead commercial person to a group of  associates  The lead commercial person a director or VP would keep in touch with and help out his group of associates to make sure they make the most of their rotations and Enron gets the most out of them

	Make sure the program stays in touch with commercial groups so these groups know when they need a clerk analyst or associate  Too often we treat analysts clerks and yearold associates with  years of experience the same  This happens way too much

	The program should work with the incoming associates a little closer to help them understand what kinds of job or what kind of career path they want to take and design a plan on how to get them there

Its hard to tell what motivates Paul Krugmans frequent attacks on Enron Enron Goes Overboard August   His latest attack is no more than a string of misstatements and nonsequitors reminiscent of a schoolyard taunt  He reveals in depth his ignorance of Enron the people who work here and the tragically botched California regulatory regime  Perhaps he seeks merely to entertain

	The broader goal of his personal attack appears to be to discredit the free market system  a system that entrusts people to make choices and enjoy the fruits of their labor skill intellect and heart He would apparently rely on a system of government controlled or sponsored monopolies to make choices for people  We disagree finding ourselves less trusting of the integrity and good faith of such institutions and their leaders  Ironically the example Krugman cites of financialization run amok the electricity market in California is the product of exactly his kind of system with active government intervention at every step  Indeed the only winners in the entire California fiasco were the government owned utilities of Los Angeles the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia  The disaster that squandered the wealth of California was born of regulation by the few not by markets of the many  So long as Krugmans elitist reasoning prevails we are doomed to repeat such mistakes

Mr Skilling consistently stated over the past few months that we needed to earn our way to a higher stock price  Following his departure Mr Lay has stated that one of his top priorities would be to rebuild our stock value  My question is will the company have any changes to existing policies in order to facilitate this growth  Will company spending Teaming events Travel and Expense Policy Investment in new technology and so on be cut back in order to bolster earnings  Basically do we have a new gameplan aside from the EBS restructuring or will we proceed forward and operate as we have been

Enrons Skilling Cites StockPrice Plunge
As Main Reason for Leaving CEO Post
By John R Emshwiller

  
The Wall Street Journal
A
Copyright c  Dow Jones  Company Inc

  Jeffrey K Skilling said that the pressure he felt from Enron Corps
plummeting stock price was the main reason he decided to resign Tuesday
as the energy giants chief executive officer after only about six
months in the job

   In an interview yesterday the yearold Mr Skilling elaborated on
his decision to leave Houstonbased Enron On Tuesday Mr Skilling
insisted he had resigned for personal reasons unrelated to Enrons
business activities
   In the interview he reiterated that he wasnt under any pressure to
resign from the companys board or Chairman Kenneth Lay who has resumed
the CEOs duties at the nations biggest energy trader

   However yesterday Mr Skilling said that his personal reasons were
deeply enmeshed with feelings that he had failed in a crucial business
area during his brief tenure as CEO Calling the companys stock
performance a kind of ultimate score card Mr Skilling noted that
Enrons share price had fallen by some  this year

   Mr Skilling said he took that stockprice drop very personally I
put a lot of pressure on myself for that decline he said I felt I
must not be communicating well enough with investors He felt this
particularly given Enrons strong financial results over the past
several quarters based largely on growing volumes in its trading
business which covers a range of items including electricity pulp and
paper

   If the stock price had remained up I dont think I would have felt
the pressure to leave he said

   In January Enron topped  a share in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading It closed Tuesday before the announcement of Mr
Skillings resignation at  a share As of  pm yesterday Enron
traded at  after falling below  during the day

   Mr Skilling who had been at Enron  years said the depressed
stock price was particularly tough to explain to fellow Enron employees
many of whom are shareholders People would say What is going on with
the stock Jeff I would have to say I didnt know It has been
frustrating said Mr Skilling

   The selfportrait offered by Mr Skilling in the interview is rather
different from the widely held image of him as an ambitious bright and
thickskinned business strategist whose longheld goal had been becoming
Enron CEO Mr Skilling said that the final straw in his decision to
leave had come on a visit last week to England in connection with the
deaths of three Enron workers in a powerplant accident there That trip
helped reinforce how tenuous life is said Mr Skilling who has three
children from a previous marriage and recently became engaged

   While Mr Skilling said Enron is in great shape his departure
raised anxiety in the investment community Merrill Lynch for instance
lowered its rating on Enron to neutral from buy based on uncertainty
created by the resignation

   Yesterday an Enron spokesman confirmed that Mr Lay plans to name
two executives to the existing office of the chairman within the next
few days or weeks The spokesman said Mr Lay hadnt yet revealed whom
the two would be The office of the chairman had consisted of Mr Lay
and Mr Skilling

To echo Greg I am now here and this is one of the many items on my agenda I have been wanting to build something like this for Enron for  years now Im a big believer that an Enron Portal will go a long way to helping Enron and its various business units consolidate its vast knowledge base to make information more readily availabe across all business units with the added benefit of reducing longer term development costs

Ive touched down in the midst of budget season   so give me a week or so and Ill come see you about this

I talked with Cindy a few weeks ago about a salary adjustment for me and Mary following the HR reorg actually this was probably end of June Cindy indicated she had discussed this with you and that some recommendations had either been agreed or where being considered I think she suggested she or you may prefer to agree a new extended employment agreement which I would be happy to discuss

Either way I really would like to close this out in the next few days since things are obviously moving on and I dont want this weighing in the back of my mind

Subject Chamber update


I spoke to Allan Zaremberg Pres of the Cal Chamber of Commerce  He
met with the Governors folks and spoke to Loretta Lynch last week to
discuss undercollection strategies the MOU and direct access  He is
not optimistic that any of these issues will be resolved to the
Chambers satisfaction  The Govs folks truly believe that the
successful bond issuance depends upon an end to direct access  Even if
Bowen gets cooperation on her legislation  Allan believes she doesnt
really want to do it and is not sure she can get a signature  I told
him that Burton said he would sign off on a direct access bill if Bowen
agrees to it  That gave him little encouragement because he doesnt see
much motivation for Bowen to press on the Governor and Angelides
Allans view corresponds with everyone weve spoken to whobelieve that
nothing major will happen legislatively  A subsequent conversation with
Hertzbergs office confirms that they feel unable to move an energy
agenda at this time although they have not given up"

Steve

Here are a few thoughts on the management committee meeting at the Woodlands

I would stay away from a general reporting on what is happening if at all possible  and focus
on a few things we really need to work on as well as a few things we should remind ourselves
are going quite well  If we only focus on the problems I fear the group will walk away a bit
demoralized

Second  I think we should move to many things getting driven by subcommittees of the
Management committee  And then the recommendations sometimes being approved
by the Management committee

Here are a few subjects that we should touch on and initiate debate but not try and
solve  get them started and turn over to a subcommittee
PRC process
Diversity
Giving the right signal to our business about the value and cost of capital
What new businesses do we have going
Is now the right time for Xcelerator
More detailed external financial reporting
How do we describe ourselves to the outside world and inside world  What messages
  do we want to modify
What are the characteristics where our business model works and doesnt work
How well is our RAC process really working
We are a business where our biggest cost is people and that cost has blown out
  during the last few years  do we need to think about our biggest cost any
  differently than we did five years ago
How challenged are we really in getting substantial credit for Enron now that it 
our credit spreads
Enrons normal new business mindset has been to overwhelm an opportunity  EBS EES
power  When this works it really pays off but in todays financial markets is a more conservative
approach warranted

Anyway those are just a few ideas  One of the things we might do tomorrow is solicit 
ideas from the entire committee in writing and work on those items of most interest

Traders Old Utilities Tangle Over Wires 
By Dan Morgan
Washington Post Staff Writer
Thursday August   Page A 
Last of three articles
ATLANTA
Ever since steamboat captain WP Lay founded Alabama Power Co in  to develop electricity along the Coosa River utility companies have been stringing wires throughout the South for one purpose so southerners could have power and light
Now a bunch of outsiders who buy and sell electricity but dont have a single retail customer below the MasonDixon line have their sights set on those wires and they are getting a helping hand from some powerful allies in Congress and the Bush administration
Aided by supercomputers and operating out of trading rooms as big as hockey rinks the new breed of traders buy blocks of electricity anywhere along the nations power grid then borrow transmission lines to ship it to the highest bidder But to more effectively move power from where it is cheap to where it is in strong demand they want to remove what they contend is a wire curtain around the South That means forcing the southeastern utilities to relinquish control of the wires to a new federally supervised regional authority
The monopoly is the wires and thats where the battles occur said Jeffrey K Skilling who was chief executive of Houstons Enron Corp the largest of the power merchants until he resigned last week
The clash grows out of a huge federal gamble on electricity deregulation
In  with many utility behemoths staggering under debt from cost overruns on nuclear plants and the rapid spread of computer technology putting new demands on the grid Congress opted for a competitive market The plan was to dismantle longstanding utility monopolies and replace them with innovative electricity companies responsive to the laws of supply and demand
Now these new merchants of power along with restructured utilities that have shed their old ways and embraced the new competitive world have become strong advocates for a freeflowing national electricity market But in a classic Washington lobbying confrontation they are running into resistance from traditional utilities exemplified by Atlantas Southern Co now the parent of Alabama Power and other southern utilities
At issue is how fast the federal government in the wake of the California electricity crisis should push for yet more changes
Last month the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC recently stocked with President Bushs promarket appointees ordered most utilities to negotiate with federal mediators on procedures for handing over control of their wires to a few big regional authorities Those authorities in turn will build new transmission lines do away with bottlenecks set uniform rates and ensure equal access to all Next month the Senate will take up proposals to give FERC even more authority to restructure the electricity industry
But what is good for Enron may not necessarily be good for utility customers in the South according to executives at Southern Co whose affiliates dominate power sales in Georgia Alabama Mississippi and north Florida Southern Co Chairman H Allen Franklin said in a recent interview will not go blindly into the system proposed by FERC
Although unfettered access to Southerns  miles of lines might help longdistance sellers of wholesale power such as Enron company officials say it could mean congestion power outages and higher prices for their  million retail customers
When California was restructured it was thought there would be massive savings Franklin said Well there havent been
Building the Power Trade
If the California energy crisis left doubts about the future of a competitive market in electricity a visit to Houston dispels them
In the citys energy alley Enron Corp  with annual sales of more than  billion last year double those of Texaco  is finishing a new floor office building adjacent to its story tower Enrons competitors Dynegy Inc Reliant Energy and El Paso Energy are a few blocks away Duke Energy North American merchant arm of Charlottebased Duke Power has settled in as well And Calpine Corp plans to take over  floors of a new story building near Enron
These power merchants are at the center of a burgeoning unregulated wholesale market which now handles about a quarter of US electricity output But it is still a work in progress fluid and accommodating in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest but much less open in the South
In exchange for utilities opening up their transmission lines to the new wholesale market the  Energy Policy Act law allowed them to buy or build unregulated power plants outside their service areas Many did Quickest to embrace competition were California and the Northeast which had long endured high power costs To spur competition California and some northeastern states went further requiring utilities to sell off their regulated plants and begin buying bulk power from wholesalers
Many states went further still ending their utilities long monopoly over retail sales and allowing customers to pick their own electricity provider
The Northeast already was something of a mecca for power traders because of its experiments with power pooling in which groups of utilities merge their separate transmission systems and use a central manager to market and distribute their electricity
Enron formed in  by the merger of two big gaspipeline companies was quick to seize the opportunities Its chairman Kenneth Lay a former official at the Federal Power Commission FERCs precursor during the Nixon administration had pioneered natural gas trading during the volatile period of pipeline deregulation in the s
As the electricity market began to develop in the early s Lay and Skilling a weekend dirt biker with a degree from Harvard Business School began applying some of the lessons learned in the natural gas markets
Enron signed its first longterm power contract in  Skilling recalls Independent companies that wanted to install gasfired generators and sell the power on the grid could buy the gas from Enron under longterm contract  then sell the electricity back to Enron
We started creating forward and futures markets using a lot more financial engineering than was required in other commodity businesses Skilling said By the late s Enron was buying the output of generating plants days weeks months and even years before it was produced using sophisticated weather and economic data to predict a price at which it could be profitably sold
During the past five years Enron has been one of the nations fastestgrowing companies Its net income rose  percent in the second quarter of this year although the price of a share has sunk to less than half of its  high of  mainly because of setbacks in businesses unrelated to electricity Investors pushed the price still lower after Skillings departure last week
Southern Inhospitality
Like other merchants Enron plunged into California after the legislature opened up that giant state to electricity competition But the Southeast remained lessfriendly territory
Texas is the only southern state to adopt retail deregulation Florida goes so far as to ban outofstate companies from building almost any plant for the wholesale market
The region is the domain of huge traditional utilities that control the wires from Louisiana to Florida and up into Appalachia and the Carolinas The web of power lines tied to the utilities coal nuclear and gasfired generating plants reaches across states via kilovolt workhorses and down into neighborhoods served via single wires strung on wooden poles
For Southern Co its reputation as a traditional utility heavy is a badge of pride In  it displayed a picture of a gorilla on its annual report
Clustered around its borders are Entergy another huge holding company that serves Louisiana Arkansas and parts of Mississippi and Texas Florida Power  Light Carolina Power  Light Duke Power and the federal governments centralized power giant the Tennessee Valley Authority
Those utilities have been under little pressure from customers to share the lines with wholesale competitors in the interest of lower prices Prices run  percent or more below the national average thanks to a rich lode of coal and natural gas and general public acceptance of the hightension lines that carry the power generated by those fuels
FERC in a series of orders from  to  required utilities to open their wires for power shipments by independent merchants and to post how much transmission capacity they have available at any given time The message a former official said was they couldnt use the wires to preclude others from getting their juice to market
But merchants say it is difficult to ascertain the accuracy of the postings made by the southeastern utilities because they operate the transmission lines as part of their closed planttocustomer systems
A November  FERC staff investigation of bulk power markets in the Southeast concluded that the transmission monopoly enjoyed by the regions utilities has discouraged independent power producers from siting new plants in the region
FERC investigators cited Southern Cos refusal to let SkyGen Energy Inc connect to its transmission lines in Alabama Southern said the added load would cause an areawide stability problem for electric supply
In that case FERC denied SkyGens request for relief
Enron Vice President Kevin Presto said that dayahead sales to customers such as municipal utilities in Southerns territory have become possible But he said Enron has trouble getting longterm transmission commitments from Southern that would enable it to sell such power regularly Also he said Enron cannot easily move power long distances through Southerns grid If I tried to buy transmission across Southern Co to Jacksonville Electric thered be zero available Presto said
Of the overall situation in the Southeast he said that the utilities give you  to  percent of their transmission capability because they preserve the rest of it for native load retail customers So you have a huge highway thats supposed to promote the free sale of electrons that isnt available to the wholesalers
Southern Co Chairman Franklin dismissed as unfounded the complaints of the merchants and officials representing Alabama and Georgia municipal utilities tied to Southern Cos lines say they generally have been treated well
Robert Johnston president of the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia MEAG which supplies power to  towns took issue with the notion of a wire curtain
The market is growing in Georgia he said MEAG has its own trading room and has done business with a hundred or so traders or independent power producers It also has its own generators producing power at four sites though Southern Co has an interest in all of them
Theres not a grassroots interest driving the reforms Franklin said Its the wholesale players
While it squares off against the newcomers in the Southeast though Southern itself has aggressively exploited the growing wholesale market Until it was spun off as a separate company earlier this year Mirant Corp Southern Cos marketing subsidiary competed in California the Midwest and the North supplementing leaner profits from Southern Cos regulated units
Southerns strategy has been clear Compete elsewhere and run a monopoly at home said Allen Mosher director of policy analysis at the American Public Power Association
Well Connected for Battle
The next move is up to the federal government
Next month Sen Jeff Bingaman DNM chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee plans to propose legislation giving FERC expanded powers over wholesale transactions and transmission so that vested interests will not be able to manipulate the use of the transmission system to benefit their own plants Bingamans office said
In the House key players will be Commerce Committee Chairman WJ Billy Tauzin RLa whose state is home to Southern Cos western neighbor Entergy and Rep Joe Barton RTex chairman of the energy and environment subcommittee who has had close ties to the huge coaldependent Texas utility TXU
Last week Entergy hired former FERC chairman Curt L Hebert Jr a Mississippi protg of Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott RMiss to handle regulatory and government affairs
Enron recently hired a former aide to House Majority Leader Richard K Armey RTex as well as a former senior spokesman in the Bush campaign Edward Gillespie of Quinn Gillespie  Associates
Enron officials are counting on support from House Majority Whip Tom DeLay RTex the hometown Houston congressman though it is uncertain how much influence DeLay an enthusiast for electricity deregulation can bring to bear
Industry lobbyists who gathered on Capitol Hill in July for closeddoor meetings that DeLay sponsored but did not attend could not reach consensus on electricity As a result the energy bill passed by the House on Aug  skirted key issues involving greater accessibility to the grid and electricity reliability
Bushs election and the fact that many utilities have plunged enthusiastically into the competitive market clearly has created a more favorable political climate for the power merchants Bushs first two appointees to FERC Pat Wood III and Nora Mead Brownell moved quickly to fix what they viewed as the Washington electricity bottleneck
Wood had worked with Enron during a sixyear effort to create a more competitive energy market in Texas where Wood headed the states public utility commission Brownell a former Pennsylvania utility regulator won praise from Enron in  when she helped block a restructuring plan that Enron contended would keep it out of the Philadelphia market
On July  with a majority in tow Wood Brownell and William L Massey a Clinton appointee who is an ardent supporter of competition tossed out proposals by Southern Co and other utilities and directed utilities throughout the country to commence negotiations with federal mediators on handing over control of their lines to four independent regional transmission organizations or RTOs
It was about time a bomb was dropped Wood said
But FERCs action may only have been what power associations Mosher calls the beginning of a long movie
Among those opposing expanded FERC authority are environmentalists who are fearful that new federal powers could lead to an expansion of highvoltage power lines western propertyrights advocates and state utility regulators Politically wellconnected groups not now regulated by FERC  including the TVA rural electric coops and municipal power systems  are also wary of new federal powers
There are big questions about FERCs role who will determine transmissionline charges should there be federal authority to site power lines should there be FERC jurisdiction over power generation and reliability said Rep Richard Burr RNC vice chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee
Idaho utility regulator Marsha Smith who heads the electricity committee for the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners noted that her states three investorowned utilities cannot transfer ownership or control of their transmission lines without our approval
Such approval does not seem likely anytime soon Smith noted that  percent of the states power comes from hydroelectric dams Thats public property she said
In Alabama James Sullivan a state utility regulator overseeing Southern Cos affiliate said he was not happy about the way FERC was proceeding
Im opposed to any changes to our electric system in Alabama until I know its going to bring rates down and enhance reliability for us he said
In the view of Southern Co Chairman Franklin it is still an open question whether FERC has the legal authority to force utilities to surrender control of all their wires
Nonetheless the restructuring of the power markets may already have gone too far to put the genie back in the bottle according to a former FERC official
The power merchants readily concur
Everybodys paying too much because youve got this huge conservatism built into this bureaucratic operation of the utilities Enrons Presto said

Are we required to have a formal severance plan  Can we opt not to have a severance plan and simply handle matters on a casebycase basis perhaps with rule of thumb guidelines

If we are required to have such a plan should we centrally administer the plan to avoid inconsistencies

My original message regarding the employee involved was raising a somewhat broader concern  Perhaps because our plans are complicated we have had occasions where an employee was told something what he she was told was incorrect he she changed position based on what he she was told and then we made the employee bear the risk of the mistake  Obviously the right answer is to get it right the first time but on those occasions where we made the mistake do we have the flexibility to fix it

AttorneyClient Privileged Communication

Steve 

Rick asked me to send you an email regarding a contact with top SCE management about our Complaint against SCE for removing our Negative CTC Credits from our current bills   While we have filed a Complaint with the CPUC and are withholding payments the CPUC may not act until it is too late to recoup our credits because our contracts with have expired  As you know there is a view among some at the CPUC that the Negative CTC Credits can only be recovered as a bill offset and is not a cash obligation  Therefore SCE restoring the credits to the bills may be the only means to realize our  million account receivable

Today Richard Sanders reported that Reliant Mirant and others were soliciting Enrons participation in an involuntary filing to be filed possibly as soon as tomorrow  Is there any merit in contacting SCE top management and offering to trade our nonparticipation for restoration of our Negative CTC Credits to our bills

Hold on  Dan and I discussed it but it is not my call whether anyone other than EES bears those costs  For what its worth I agreed with Dan that to the extent Tom and Ken had reached agreement regarding among other things Toms use of the corporate aircraft for nonEES purposes that it may not make sense to have EES bear those costs  But it was clear in my conversation with Dan that it was not my call to make

Dan had a discussion with Steve Kean regarding expense attributable to Tom White during   It is my understanding from their discussion that they agreed that EES should not have to bear these costs and that I should get with you to get the appropriate place to charge them

Subject Feedback on resignation


Dear Mr Lay
 
I submitted my resignation Wednesday the fifthteenth of this month My resignation is somewhat reluctant as Ive always received excellent reviews and even won an EES Power Player award My experiences at Enron prior to the last few months has been very positive Ive learned a lot and have made many friends
 
Your presentation at the allemployee meeting inspired me to share some important thoughts with you I hope that my input will ultimately make Enron a better place My employment began with EES where I worked with the Facilities team I enjoyed the fast pace and high profile nature of the job I felt very successful and satisfied After working with EES for a little over a year I transfered to EBS to work with their facilities team Again I experienced a great deal of success and received frequent positive feedback
 
With the EBS reorganization all facilities activities and personnel were absorbed into EPSC led by Bill Donovan I never had the opportunity to meet him However my direct supervisor was Janelle Duree I was initially very excited about the move to Corp I knew that Enron was very supportive of employee education training and growth opportunities I was convinced that I would be able to take advantage of all the opportunities that the company offered me such as partial reimbursement for my Masters Degree I currently hold a BBA in Accounting and Computer Information Systems I was also very excited to take courses such as AutoCad that would make me more valuable to the facilities team and allow my career to advance Both of these opportunities were made clear to me under my previous supervisors In fact I had already enrolled in an AutoCad course when I transferred to Corp
 
What happened next and continued over the next couple of months is simply unbelievable considering Enrons stated Values and Vision not to mention the corporate culture were all so proud of
 
I was informed by my new supervisor that a Masters Degree was in no way necessary to perform the duties assigned to me When I asked about setting my goals and discussing career paths I was told that that wouldnt be necessary I had reached the top there was no place for me to go from here When I asked how PRC was handled my supervisor told me that I would be evaluated according to my communication and organizational skillsthat would be all that Id need to succeed in the environment I was also told to cancel the AutoCad course it was also unnecessary In effect I was told to lower my expectations I still find this attitude completely unacceptable
 
If this wasnt bad enough a month later I was told that I was no longer a Specialist I was now a Customer Service Rerpresentative and as such would be paid by the hour It is clear that in an environment like Enron this signaled a tremendous setback for my career I was demoted although by all accounts Ive been an invaluable asset to each group that Ive worked with In fact all the managers that had been brought to Corp from other groups were also demoted their peer groups were changed to reflect Senior Specialist levels When we complained to HR we were told that they were completely within their rights and that the decision was final  Unfortunately it was clear that the only means by which I could give my career a fighting chance was to look outside of Enron
 
The good news is that I did find an opportunity I have been promoted to the equivalent of a Senior Specialist The bad news is that the company is not Enron I really dont like the idea of leaving Enron but I feel like I was left without a choice What concerns me the most is that Enrons greatest asset has always been its people If this is really true then its a huge shame your are rapidly losing the most important resource you have
 
As I mentioned earlier I am writing you because I truly feel you care about Enrons continued growth and success I think you need to know what is happening in the organization and the sort of impact it has on your personnel
 
Thank you very much for your time and consideration
 
Respectfully submitted

Just an observation and suggestion regarding the recent media blitz  Make sure employees have access to Enrons side of the story via additional eBiz features or an espeak feature with the Office of the Chairman when the rd quarter earnings are released

I hear people talking about some of these articles like the NY Times article this weekend and the Off Wall Street article a few weeks ago and they dont know what to think  The general employee population does not understand our financials and how Enron makes markets  At least this is my perception based on conversations that I hear in the elevators and on the bus on my to from work  

Anyway my observation is that the problem with being misunderstood does not reside just on the outside

Subject	Marlys Palumbo

Dear Jim

I have a good friend here in Seattle named Ralph Palumbo who is one of the
attorneys with whom we prosecuted the antitrust case against Microsoft that
we settled last year  His wife Marlys whom I also know well is a
candidate for appointment as the administrator of Region  of the
Environmental Protection Agency which encompasses Washington Oregon
Idaho and Alaska  I know that you are busy as hell but I wanted to set
out below some information about Marlys and about the status of her efforts
to win this appointment and then ask whether Enron might be interested in
supporting her candidacy by putting in a good word at the White House

Marlys received her law degree from Seattle University in   She then
spent four years as a commercial litigation associate at Bogle  Gates in
Seattle  From  she was general counsel of Sabey Corporation a
diversified real estate development holding company  From  she
was vice president and general counsel of Philip Environmental Inc
formerly Burlington Environmental which was a publicly traded 
million waste management and environmental engineering and remediation
company with operations in the US and Canada  In  that company merged
with two other public companies to form Philip Services Corporation  From
the date of the merger through the present Marlys has been Senior VP Law
of Philip Services Corp which is a  billion company that provides
integrated industrial and metals recovery services to commercial and
industrial customers in North America and Europe  For the last several
years Marlys has worked out of the Philip Services corporate offices in
Houston

Marlys has indepth expertise on environmental legal and scientific issues
coupled with senior management experience in the business world  She would
bring to the table a unique ability to effect a change of direction in EPA
Region  because she has worked effectively with this Region and other
Regions for two decades  Implementing White House policies in Region 
will require the Administrator to work with a staff of longterm
professional civil servants who themselves have extensive legal and
scientific expertise  The Administrator must win their respect and must
have the personal skills to manage a large organization and lead it in new
directions  Marlys has the experience the skills and the personal
qualities that would wellsuit her to doing all of those things

Her candidacy is being supported by former EPA Administrator Bill
Ruckelshaus by other former senior EPA and Justice Department officials
and by business and industry leaders in the Northwest including CEOs or
other senior executives of Boeing Weyerhaeuser PACCAR Puget Sound Energy
Simpson Investments Simpson Timber Co Plum Creek Timber Group Delta
Airlines Burlington Northern Air Cargo Management Group FMC Corp Fluke
Capital Management and Sabey Corp

My understanding is that the appointment will be made based on
recommendations from Republican Representatives and Senators from the four
states encompassed by Region  and key people in both the EPA and the
White House  Washington has no Republican Senators but Republican
Congresswoman Jennifer Dunn has recommended Marlys to the White House

I have known Marlys since shortly after moving to Seattle in   She is
an extremely bright charming and capable person and I have a lot of
respect for her  If you think Enron would be willing to consider helping
her candidacy I know that she would be eager to meet or talk with you or
others at Enron and I can provide the names of the relevant contact people
at EPA and the White House

I am not asking that you do anything as a favor to me but only if it would
serve Enrons interests to do so  Of course this issue may be completely
outside the realm of those interests and if so I apologize for taking up
your time  I hope all is well with you and Carrin and look forward to
seeing both of you again soon

Subject	McCain Lieberman Urge GHG Reductions  White House to Likely Offer Alternative by COP

Before leaving for the August congressional recess Senator John McCain RAZ and Senator Joseph Lieberman DCT made a joint statement on the Senate floor calling for an economywide cap and trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  Please see the attached copy of their floor statements
They laid out a timeframe for consultation with stakeholders including US industry and development of legislation this fall
This follows a series of legislative activity in the Senate since the conclusion of the international climate change negotiations in Bonn Germany in July  At the talks without the support and direct participation of the US nations agreed to continue to develop the rules for the Kyoto Protocol with a target date for ratification by 
Other Senate activity includes
Committee approval of climate change legislation sponsored by Senator Robert Byrd DWVirginia and Senator Ted Stevens RAL  The bill would require development of a US climate change response strategy with a longterm goal of stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions in the US  The strategy would seek ways to mitigate emissions and promote technology innovation climate adaptation research and efforts to resolve scientific and economic uncertainties  It would authorize spending of  billion over  years
Passage of a nonbinding resolution in the Senate Foreign Relations committee calling for the US to engage in the climate change negotiations
Introduction of legislation by Senator Frank Murkowski RAL Senator Chuck Hagel RNE Senator Larry Craig RID and others that provide for tax incentives for energy efficiency and clean energy technologies increased research on climate science and government coordination on climate change
Introduction of legislation by Senator Sam Brownback RKS and Senator Ron Wyden DOR to enable reporting and provide credit for land management and sequestration under a national climate change program 
Upcoming Administration and Congressional Activity
Despite statements made last week by EPA Administrator Christine Whitman and National Security Advisory Condolezza Rice White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card said yesterday that the Bush Administration would likely have an alternative climate change proposal for consideration at the next negotiations in Morocco in lateOctober  
A key issue remains whether the Bush Administration will support mandatory programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions like a domestic cap and trade system  In March President Bush said he would not support mandatory regulation of carbon dioxide emissions at power plants  As recent events suggest consideration of mandatory programs and emissions trading including regulation of carbon will be on the Senate agenda this fall   Approaches to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will be considered through hearings and committee consideration of climate change legislation multipollutant proposals and New Source Review reform  
Enrons Advocacy
Enron will continue to promote its multipollutant proposal as a model for a domestic cap and trade program  that could also provide a framework to address carbon emissions  We will also offer our expertise on emissions trading and risk management to the Administration and Congress as they consider options to address climate change
I will keep you posted on the status and movement on these legislative proposals  Please feel free to contact me with questions about any of these proposals

 Rick has asked that all charitable contributions budgeted in his group be run through Community Relations  Ill forward the numbers to Elyse and Misha  Are there any other groups within Public Affairs that you want to do this as well  For example Palmer has made some this year as have you  

Im guessing the Terraso and Kimberly should continue to budget this in their cost centers

 What sorts of metrics do you want to show in our Skilling meeting  Im assuming for Public Affairs
	 Do you want to illustrate value added origination risk mitigation market opening earned media
	 Ill do a chart showing difference year to year and the composition of such difference  Do you want to break this down 	by group  Do you also want to illustrate headcount differences
	 In the past weve illustrated fixed empl and empl expenses vs variable everything else costs  Do you want a chart to 	illustrate this

We will begin the search for the second Enron Professorship which was 
described as Ecommerce  Since we initially discussed this a lot has 
happened in the Ecommerce world and we think it might be useful to 
redesignate the field a bit  The use of the web and technology in 
business has become a critical part of the fundamental operations of the 
business and as we think that a professorship in operations management with 
a bent toward the use of the web and other related technologies might the 
educational needs of the students better and with better long term 
results  Is this too far afield from the grant or do you think we would be

The speaker from Enron that I told you yesterday that I was interested in bringing in for the Energy Club Speaker Series is Terence H Thorn senior vice president Environmental and International Government Affairs A colleague of mine heard him speak in Kyoto in  and said he gave a superb talk As of  he was still in this position though I could not verify that he is now

The proposed topic is Global Warming Policy and the Energy Industry
How will the Bonn agreement affect global strategy What will be the nearterm and longterm consequences of the agreement
How does US nonparticipation affect US market strategies versus strategies in participating countries
What is Enrons current position on global greenhouse gas policy How is Enron managing and hedging this position
How will developing country energy markets participate in greenhouse gas mitigation

The Energy Club Speaker Series takes place every other Monday from  to  There are a number of dates open during Fall semester

I appreciate very much your help in trying to arrange this Please let me know if there is any other information you need

The survey questionnaire is attached below  It was written for the company respondents with some adjustments for government NGO and others in bold pink font  Kelly suggested that the questionnaire would benefit from your review  Please provide me your comments or any questions by Monday September

Please give me your thoughts on this  Ive had a few questions so far and I think alot of people are wondering about this  I would send it to the Executive Leads for each school the Program Department in Houston and the HR Leads  Steve  Id like your opinion to be sure that Im consistent with our corporate position 
 
Thanks
Billy

 
The purpose of this note is to update you on travel related to the recruiting efforts of the Program
 
Over the weekend President Bush asked all Americans to resume their activities but to do so with the heightened awareness that the country is now at war with terrorists and with any country that supports their activities  Enrons current position is that employees should avoid all nonessential business travel  With these things in mind and for the safety of our employees I very strongly encourage you to consider alternatives to business travel for recruiting activities  
 
Earlier this year we made the decision to emphasize realtime and direct recruiting methods which by their design require less time and presence on campus  I would now ask that each executive lead and recruiter carefully review their campus schedule   strategy and consider modifications  Technology has given us the opportunity to use tools like video conferencing telephone interviews email and CD based resume books  The focusing benefits of these tools can signficantly decrease the number of people required for oncampus presentations and interviews and in some cases may even eliminate the need for these activities  In addition to the primary concern of safety a major disruption to the travel grid like that which occurred last week could strand critical Enron business personnel in relatively remote locations
 
Later this week we will make a decision regarding participation in the National Black MBA Conference in Orlando Florida

In preparation for the Commissioner meetings later this week  attached is a copy of the most recent version of the Show Cause Motion  I am still working on it  I want to beef up the section on entities already in an ISO RTO but youll have an idea of the concepts were developing

Although we do not want to share a copy of the pleading with the Commissioners yet we thought you should see where were going on the Motion  Please call me with questions

Subject	Show Cause Motion

I spoke with Paul on Friday regarding his meeting with Adam Wenner and Doug Nickles to discuss Portland Generals concerns about the Show Cause Motion  While Doug was unsure of whether an RTO commitment would be necessary in a future sale of Portland General Adam Wenner assured Doug that FERC would definately require Portland to make an RTO commitment

In the last attempted merger with Sierra Portland made a commitment to join an RTO provided that BPA was also part of that RTO  PGE explained that because its system is so intertwined with BPA that it realistically could not join an RTO without BPA  FERC found this commitment with the BPA qualification to be acceptable

While PGE would probably be willing to make the same RTO commitment that it made last time the Show Cause Motion goes farther than that  We say in the Show Cause Motion that every entity must make an unqualified commitment to join a FERC approved RTO  It does not provide for exceptions  

A couple of things came out of Pauls meeting with Doug  First Doug asks that we delay filing the Motion for a couple of weeks to see if anything happens regarding a new sale of PGE  Doug is concerned that if we make a commitment before an agreement is reached that the existence of the commitment could delay entering into a final sales agreement  

Second we need to decide how to deal with the PGE commitment  It is unlikely that PGE will be willing to commit to RTO participation without BPA  Paul and I discussed that perhaps we could reference in the Show Cause Motion the Federal Power Marketing Agencies and the need for them to join in the RTOs in order for the utilities to make an RTO commitment  perhaps reference Pacific Northwest particularly although this looks a little transparent  The problem is that many entities will try and use this as an excuse to not join an RTO

Also Paul and I discussed the One Western RTO issue and how Enron responds to that  We talked about three possibilities  try to not take a position on the One Western RTO issue  push for RTO development in the west but try and stay out of the oneversustwoversusthree RTOs in the West  take a position saying that the west is different the California mess continues people are concerned that California will contaminate the rest of the west so we should create an RTO in the rest of the West and have California join when it gets in line with FERC  support FERCs statements that it wants one RTO in the west and push for this although most of our people tell us that this will lead to inaction on any western RTO development or   focus on the east and forget about the west

The second option causes me concern because I think that if we take this position in the West even though the West is different our position will be used against us in the East  For example some people oppose one Northeast RTO because they are concerned that New York a disfunctional market will contaminate PJM a working market  Its a slippery slope for us to try and distinguish the west from the east  If we make contrary arguments in the west they will be used against us in the east

Your thoughts are appreciated  Thanks

Sarah

I am not sure if I will see you before you get away but I am fairly sure I wont have an opportunity to say a proper farewell  

I want to tell you how much I have admired you and enjoyed working with you over the past several years  To me you have always epitomized what is good about Enron  I remember the first time I met you  you came to Jennifer Modisetts office to do a phone interview with a reporter on electricity deregulation  During the interview you never once sat down  I remember being impressed with how knowledgeable and wellspoken you were but mostly I remember being astounded by the passion you had for what you were doing  Your passion was contagious  it infected me and countless others  You made Enron more than a company you made it a cause 

Im sure youre leaving here with mixed emotions but know that you will be remembered fondly by so many people because you did great things here

Thanks for your leadership  It will be missed

Subject	California Update

Here is some additional information since the circus closed down in Sacramento on Saturday morning					

The Senate adjourned early Saturday morning closing out both the regular session and the second extraordinary session
The Assembly adjourned a few hours later closing the regular session but NOT the second extraordinary session

The Legislatures options 
 The Governor calls them back in two weeks they continue with the second extraordinary session and pick up where they left off with the bills they were working on up till Saturday morning
 The Governor calls them back in two weeks the Assembly ends the second extraordinary session they begin a third extraordinary session and the bills that were left hanging on Saturday morning must start the process from scratch  However they can pass a waiver which effectively would allow them to start a rd session AND then pick up where they left off on Saturday morning
 The Governor calls them back in two weeks and the Legislature meets briefly and shuts down without doing anything ie the Govenor can call them back but he cant make them vote

In short the Legislature has a significant amount of discretion to do what they please

Where to from here
Through its actions on Saturday morning the Senate has sent a strong signal to Davis that the Senate is not inclined to vote out an Edison bailout that differs from the version it passed prior to leaving for summer recess last July
Just before closing down on Saturday the Senate also passed a resolution declaring that the condition of electric service in California no longer consitutes a sudden and severe energy shortage and that the state of emergency proclaimed by the Governor on January   is at and end  The resolution seems to send an additional signal that the Senate does not see any great need to bail out Edison  The Assembly did not pass the resolution however  
Given the Senates view and the open hositility between Davis and Burton Davis only remaining option seems to be to threaten the Senate with vetoes unless the Senate first passes the Davis Edison bill  It is unclear at this time whether Davis would play it that tough
With the Legislature gone the action turns to the PUC where a vote on DA suspension is scheduled for Thursday  We are working with customers and providers to stop DA from being suspended or at a minimum to ensure that any suspension date is not retroactive
Finally Burton held a news conference this morning at which he said
Burton and Senator Bowen Bowens been taking the lead on DA in the Senate will ask the California PUC to do a study on how DA can be retained without adversely affecting homeowners and small businesses
He doesnt know why the Governor would waste taxpayers money to hold a special session
With all the troubled businesses in California right now he doesnt know why the State would bail Edison out and not the others

If all this sounds ridiculous it is

Well report back with additional information as we get it

Best
Jeff"

Dear Mr Lay 

As a recently terminated employee of Enron I have watched the stocks
dramatic tumble in the last weeks mount on top of the horrible performance
over the last months  As Chairman and CEO you are ultimately responsible
for everything that goes on in the company  Without getting into the
potentially criminal and certainly illconceived activities of you and other
Enron executives past and present I think you have done little but pay lip
service in order to correct things

Mr Lay you and the other executives receive very large salaries  None of
you is hurting for money  I think it unconscionable that you and other
executives continue to draw a paycheck  While employees and others like me
have seen our net worth go from respectable sums to zero you remain wealthy
beyond most of our dreams  Whats worse you take more from the company
every week in the form of pay  I realize you havent had a soul in quite
sometime  But are you so unconcerned with the wellbeing of the people like
me who believed in you and worked years and years for you that you feel
justified adding insult to injury  You have literally ruined the lives of
thousands of people  Your employees deserve better than this  I was
terminated at midyear because my book was losing  million  Thats right
 million  Thats after Id made tens of millions for you over the past
eight years  You and yours have lost me more than that of my own personal
money now  I dont quite know how to fire you

Its obvious that neither you nor any other executive currently in power at
Enron have any credibility whatsoever  Cutting off difficult questions on a
conference call or ignoring pointed questions from employees dont go along
way in restoring any credibility or respect  There is none left and yet
you continue to take money out of the Enron coffers for yourself in the form
of compensation  The hubris there is so incredible to me that it defies
comprehension

Why exactly is Enron paying you  Do you feel justified being paid by
Enron  Do you feel justified seeing Enron pay large sums of money to others
involved while those of us with our retirement and childrens education
funds tied up in Enron suffer more

I worked at Enron from May of  until this month  I watched my net worth
increase substantially with my hard work at Enron  Now in the blink of an
eye my net worth has plummeted to levels I havent experienced since long
before I went to work at Enron  I worked there for nearly nine years and
now have nothing to show for it  Well thats not entirely true  I have
learned a valuable lesson  I will never put my faith in someone again like
I did in you  I now know that you couldnt care less about the wellbeing
of your employees  You do still however show an incredible capacity for
greed  You continue to rob the company of funds that could be going to more
useful places

As I said I was terminated because my book had  million in losses YTD
based on a couple of bad trades and some bad positions I inherited  In this
payforperformance world where does that leave you  You continue to
enrich yourself while losing billions of dollars every single day  I
imagine the PRC would have looked poorly on me if I lost  of the
companys value each day the market was open

I no longer work for Enron but I am left holding the bag with a ton of
worthless options and shares in my k  I only have a short time in
which to exercise those options  I dont have the luxury of waiting for
enough good news to come out of the company to make them valuable  Im just
one of the thousands upon thousands of financial lives youve ruined  The
very people that have made you rich you have made poor  And somehow you
seem to smile as you keep doing it

Id like your response as to why you feel it necessary for you and notable
others to continue to take money from the rest of us in the form of a
paycheck  Please write me back

Sincerely


Scott Hendrickson

   Subject  Security Update


   Enron  has  been increasing security at its facilities around the world
   Some  of  the  changes took effect immediately eg additional security
   personnel  and  some are phasing in  While not all of the changes will
   be  visible  there  are  a  few  that  will  have an impact on everyday
   activities   In  all  the steps we take and recommendations we make we
   will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring to
   increase  your  sense  of  security  while  doing  our best to minimize
   disruption to our daytoday business

   Primary  responsibility for Enron Corp Security resides in our business
   controls  organization  You can contact this organization through their
   website  http  homeenroncom security by phone  or
   by                   email                  
      John  Brindle Senior Director
   Business Controls leads this organization  Please feel free to provide
   John  and  his  team  with  your  comments  and  questions or to report
   security threats

   We  have  two  areas to update you on  changes in the access procedures
   for  the  Enron  Center  Campus  in  Houston  and  changes to our travel
   advisory

   Access to the Enron Center

   Over  the next few days the following access control procedures will be
   instituted at the Enron Center and other facilities where practical

          As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the
           Enron  Center  a guard will match the photo on the badge to the
           bearer

          Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a
           valid  picture  ID  to  obtain  access to the Enron Center US
           drivers license US or foreign passport or some form of US
           federal state or local identification

           Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when
           signing  in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill
           out  the  visitor card  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID
           US  drivers  license US or foreign passport or some form
           of  US  federal  state  or  local identification will not be
           allowed access to the Enron Center

           Visitors  to  Enron  facilities  must  be  escorted by an Enron
           employee or badged contractor at all times

           Visitors  to  the  Enron  Center will be met in the lobby by an
           Enron employee or badged contractor signed into a visitors log
           at   the   lobby  reception  area  by  the  employee  or  badged
           contractor   and   escorted   to  their  appointment   At  the
           conclusion  of  the appointment the visitor will be escorted to
           the lobby by an employee or badged contractor the visitor badge
           collected  and  the  visitor signed out in the log at the plaza
           reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor

          Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of
           their workplace by following these guidelines report suspicious
           activity  to  Security phone  do not open secured doors
           for  individuals  unknown  to  you  or hold doors open allowing
           tail gating by others

   These  will  be  the  first in a series of new security procedures to be
   instituted  at  Enron   We  ask  that  all  employees be patient during
   congested  times in the lobby  As we proceed and obtain increased guard
   personnel  and  equipment  we expect the inconvenience to decrease  We
   hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security
   of all our employees


   Travel Advisory Update

   With  the  beginning  of  retaliatory  strikes  we  have  two important
   recommendations

           While  the  retaliatory strikes are ongoing corporate security
           recommends that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided
           We  continue  to  strongly recommend that all travel during this
           time  to  Afghanistan  Yemen  Pakistan Indonesia Iran Iraq
           Sudan  Somalia  Tajikistan  Turkmenistan  Georgia  and  the
           Kyrgyz  Republic  be  canceled   In addition we recommend that
           planned   travel  to  Egypt  Israel  Gaza West  Bank  Jordan
           Lebanon  Saudi  Arabia  Syria  and  Algeria be very carefully
           considered

           For nonUS citizens traveling in the United States corporate
           security  recommends  that  you carry documentation  There have
           been  several  recent reports of nonUS citizens who reside in
           the  United  States being questioned and asked for documentation
           when  boarding  US  domestic  flights As a result we suggest
           that  all  nonUS  citizens who currently reside in the United
           States    and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status 
           carry their passport Form I and Form I at all times  We
           would  also  suggest  that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their
           Permanent  Resident  Green  Card as proof of their status as a
           precautionary  measure   It  appears that Immigration Officials
           may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act
           that  requires  individuals  over the age of  to carry his her
           registration  documentation  with  them at all times This can
           include  a  Permanent  Resident Card Form I card Employment
           Authorization   Card  Border  Crossing  Card  or  a  Temporary
           Resident  Card Immigration Officials have not historically been
           asking  domestic travelers for registration documentation but
           in  light  of  the  heightened  security  measures  and  current
           atmosphere  it  would  be  best to be prepared with all of your
           documentation proving your current lawful status

   We  will  keep  you  apprised of new information and developments on the
   Corporate Security website and by email as appropriate

In the first paragraph Citigroup wants to use including due diligence and delete final

In the fifth paragraph Citigroup wants to use the phrase in a few days rather than shortly

Once the terms of the agreement are finalized we plan to issue this release before the opening of the market Thursday  am  If you have any comments or changes please let me and Steve Kean know by email or voicemail

Subject	Rescheduled  Management Conference

Ken Greg and Mark

I wanted to provide you a suggested agenda for the rescheduled Management Conference  After working with Joannie Williamson to coordinate open dates on your calendars with hotel availability here is what we are proposing

Location   Westin La Cantera Resort San Antonio The Woodlands still will not have enough rooms to hold our group in February  We are concerned that if we dont have people committed to stay over especially on a weekend we risk weak participation  Also by rebooking with the Starwood property we hope to potentially recoup some of the loss incurred by canceling our November date and maintain a positive relationship with the company

Dates   Friday February  and Saturday February  We received feedback that employees may not appreciate being asked to sacrifice a weekend right now  However these are the dates that the hotel is available  Available dates the previous week would interfere with Valentines Day and coincide with the peak of the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City 

Agenda	

DAY 		Friday February 

pm  pm	Registration

pm  pm	Reception and Chairmans Dinner
		Speaker  General Norman Schwarzkopf  The General is currently available on this date but has not accepted the engagement  I feel that if we can 		reschedule him he would be a significant draw to ensure people arrive in time for the evening activities

DAY 		Saturday February 

am  pm	Business Agenda  I will keep Ken and the brief business unit presentations panel on the agenda  I also hope to reschedule Gary Hamel  Otherwise I will		remain flexible on the agenda

pm		Meeting Adjourns

		No planned activities  The activities are perceived as an unnecessary extravagance at this time

Wed like to issue a memo about postponing the Management Conference to invitees as soon as possible  While details on the agenda can be resolved later please let me know if you are comfortable with the dates and location so we can include that information in the memo

Regards
Terrie James

During this critical time it is imperative that our management team remain focused on our business and continue to address the challenges currently facing our company  For that reason I have decided to postpone the Enron Management Conference

The Conference will now be held Friday February   Saturday February   at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio  While the Saturday meeting allows some Enron executives who cannot be away from the office during business hours to attend the Management Conference for the first time I also recognize that it requires many of you to forfeit additional personal time on behalf of Enron  I truly appreciate your sacrifice and I sincerely encourage your attendance

The new agenda while still being finalized will be abbreviated but every bit as informative and worthwhile as previously planned  Well be in touch soon with more details

Q  From a business standpoint are Gipper and Rockne now one company

A  Not until closing which may not occur for several months  Until that time the law antitrust law requires that we continue to deal with one another on a commercial level as competitors just as we have in the past  In general this means that we cannot share commercial information coordinate commercial behavior agree on prices etc  We should act towards Rockne the same way that we would act toward any other competitor

Steve

Corporate Business Controls  Position Elimination  Portland Office 
I wanted to ensure that you were aware that Johns group has one  employee Chad Beers in the Portland office who will be asked to relocate to Houston no later than    as the position in Portland is scheduled to be eliminated effective     
Therefore if the employee elects not to accept the position in Houston his employment would be terminated on    and he would be scheduled to receive the current business reorganization severance

Based on this request I plan to send Chad a Relocation Offer letter which also includes the information summarized above along with a severance calculation estimate  

Could you please respond to this email to indicate your concurrence  If you do concur I will proceed with associated paperwork


Thank you Steve

Subject	Dabhol Washington Update 


	Here is an update on the state of play in Washington regarding Dabhol as the Indian PM arrives this evening

	As it became apparent last week that the discussions in Delhi about the MOU were not panning out I met with OPIC President Watson and Exec VP Connelly to bring them up to speed on the status of discussions and map out the message to be given by the Administration to the PM on his visit this week  While OPIC certainly does not have final say re the message on Dabhol they are clearly the driver within the USG and they have been very aggressive in that regard  Out of our meeting Watson sent to State and the NSC a message with the following two points
	  the Project sponsors the  lenders and OPIC and EXIM are of one mind that the negotiating time frame on Dabhol is approaching its end  If India does not act immediately it will be too late
	  The President and this Administration needs to express its strong disappointment at the failure of the GOI to make an effort to engage on the Buyout which needs to be negotiated within a particular  range subject to a simultaneous negotiation with the  lenders

	The OPIC memo was sent to State and the NSC and is now embodied in talking points for President Bush in his Friday meeting with the PM  For the last week plus I have provided daily updates to OPIC to Larsons office at State to the South Asia regional group and to the NSC so they know of any new developments and where we are  Yesterday afternoon I  met with OPIC on the lawsuit and how that might change the talking points

	At this point President Bush will raise Dabhol in his meeting with the PM Friday The Indian Ambassador met with the NSC yesterday to discuss the agenda and was briefed on the MOU going in
	It is being considered that Larry Lindsey will discuss Dabhol in greater detail probably with Mishra  There was some concern about prior relationship to Enron but I understand from State the lawyers have taken care of the concern   
	Larson is in Doha but is current on the situation and can engage if necessary  It is unfortunate he is out of town
	Amb Blackwill had dinner last night with Watson and Connelly of OPIC and claims he is on top of the issue

	Last but certainly not least we have a meeting with the PMO Secretary Ghash  at  Thursday at the Indian Embassy  I do not know if we have firmly decided yet who should attend  If Jim is out as I understand he is perhaps Rob Walls and I can attend  This meeting should give us an opportunity to respond in the Washington context to the proposal that I understand is in the offing in Singapore  We will then be in a position to feed that information back into the USG so that the Presidents meeting with the PM reflects the current state of discussions

Subject Judges Final SE RTO Mediation Report  CN summary


The ALJ submits her report to FERC to obtain FERC review of the Southeast Power Grid platform that resulted from the mediation 
 
 JUDGES FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS  FERC should consider adoption of Grid Model the one Enron likes best to fullest extent possible and that remaining unresolved issues be addressed through continued stakeholder process  However since complete consensus was not reached FERC should provide its determination of which of the two models best meets FERCs expectations as a platform for the SE Power Grid RTO  This should be done by FERC quickly  There should be no further delay  Regardless of the model FERC should encourage the collaborative process  She thinks that this should be done by the parties without FERC intervention except to the extent to respond to FERC orders I think FERC staff should be involved or it will get bogged down  Parties should reconvene within  days after FERCs order adopting a model and the FERC order should direct the participants like us to submit a joint proposal within  days thereafter  She recommends to FERC that parties be allowed to file comments to FERC within  days however she recommends against permitting reply comments since they may prove counterproductive to the collaborative nature of the mediation process  The Commission will then issue an order that can adopt her recommendations may reject her recommendations or change something  I would expect that the Commission would adopt many of her recommendations while allowing further mediatedtype discussions on some issues hopefully FERC will adopt many of our suggested changes  Judge McCartney then basically describes both proposals of the Grid Group and the Southern etal group then provides the stakeholder participants comments almost verbatim from all submissions to her  While she states that the process should keep moving quickly she does not adopt any timeframes we will comment that FERC should retain its Dec  Day  start date for LMP financial rights congestion model to be implemented
 
The attachments below are her report the Southern etal proposal and the Grid pricing congestion management operating and planning protocols without any changes  Clearly our response FERC will include our proposed changes to the documents  Highlights from her report below

She recommends that SPP pursue an RTO coalition in the Midwest 
She encourages FERC to continue to encourage and utilize a collaborative process which accommodates stakeholders and state utility commission input regardless of the RTO platform ultimately adopted by FERC 
Her opinion is that the Grid Entergy GridSouth and GridFlorida utility sponsored Model transco in RTO LMP financial rights congestion management is better developed and more clearly in compliance with the requirements of Order No  based on a best practices analysis of other RTOs and Commission precedent  This is good because Enron generally favors the Grid model However she does provide the Commission information on Southern etals proposal independent system administratorlike National Gridtype in her report even though she has concerns that the Southern etal model is not Order No  compliant  The Southern etal model has a hybrid physical congestion management with day ahead balanced schedule requirements and LMP in real time with penalties and significant control area responsibilities  The significant aspects of the Grid model are discussed below 
Grid Governance RTO is a for profit transco with an independent board and an enhancement  the Independent Market Administrator IMA  The IMA was added to facilitate public power participation worried that transmission owner on top even if divested from generation would favor its transmission solutions over generation or other transmission solution  The IMA would administer the markets exercise operational authority over the transmission system administer one OASIS with one process for interconnection and transmission requests and assume the Security Coordinator function  She strongly encourages this split 
Good stakeholder advisory Committee provides majority and minority views and an independent Market Monitor to monitor the RTO and the markets 
Allows for Independent Transmission Companies Entergy wants to be one with RTO oversight 
Describes that control area operators will initially maintain their control areas for physical operation such as switching transmission elements pursuant to operating procedures approved by the RTO IMA  Recognizes that consolidation of control areas may occur as RTO matures  Protocols should be subject to further discussion 
RTO transco has primary responsibility for tariff administration including rate changes and tariff filings 
All load under the rates terms and conditions of OATT GridSouth group has appealed this part of earlier Commission orders and thus retains their rights should they win on appeal 
 transmission pricing zones initially Entergy Southern GridSouth and GridFlorida  Allows for participant funded direct assigned and merchant transmission  Transmission rates to loads in RTO will be zonal for existing facilities and regional charge for new facilities other than those above  There will be one through and out rate plus a Grid Management Charge for RTO operation 
Encourages conversion of existing transmission agreements to OATT 
Financial Rights LMP includes real time spot market is clearly the preferred model and represents best practices model from PJM and SPP  many details need to be worked out in continued discussions  Model allows parties to transact bilaterally and provides financial congestion hedges FCH  Stakeholder process needs to be continued for FCH allocation auction and nondiscriminatory release  The Grid model includes a balancing resource requirement that we will provide comments against 
Will allow establishment of markets for ancillary services once they can be supported  control area operators required to provide before such market establishment 
RTO runs single OASIS and independently calculates ATC and TTC 
RTO transco is responsible for planning through a participatory stakeholder process 
Numerous comments from marketers IPPs on reduction of control area functions all of our comments from last weeks response are included 
Judge McCartney had numerous meetings with state commissioners   Many are still concerned that FERC had not conducted a costbenefit analysis and had concerns over the costs  She responds that extrapolation of costs to the entire SE RTO seems unwarranted because it ignores the economies of scale and initial reliance on existing control centers and infrastructure  In any event FERC could explore the feasibility of a rate setting process that would involve the state commissions  concerned about cost shifting  mediation team discussed phase in of rates that the Commission has allowed  Concern that SE RTO would preempt state ability to approve asset transfers to RTO and want state retail customers to receive full value for assets   concern that SE RTO may prematurely put Southern states into retail open access concerns with Cal  Judge encourages the Commission to utilize a collaborative process that includes input from state commissioners

I think our message for any press discussions tomorrow should focus on the extremely beneficial aspects of the mediation and the significant jump start it gave to the SE RTO process due to the significant role played by Judge McCartney and her team on focusing the discussions  Furthermore the initial results after  days show the majority of participants favoring a best practices PJM SPP cornerstone type real time spot energy market with LMP pricing and financial congestion hedges and an RTO with an independent board structure that accommodates a forprofit RTO entity with a significant stakeholder advisory process  The Commission should consider utilize the fundamentals resulting from this mediation for other regions or at a minimum consider similar mediated jump starts

Jim  We have been getting a large number of media calls about the A filing which discusses Ken Lays change of control provision in his contract  We would like to use the following with media  and internal meetings with employees

	Change of control provisions are very common at the CEO level  Ken has had a change of control provision in his employment contract since   It enables him to trigger an involuntary termination in the event of a change of control which includes a merger or consolidation with another corporation and Enron is not the surviving corporation  This would have gone into effect in the event of a hostile takeover or the announced merger with Dynegy


Please let me know ASAP if we are able to use this statement

Nov   PM
Jackson says coalition wants role in energy deal 
By NELSON ANTOSH 
Copyright  Houston Chronicle 
Activist Jesse Jackson says the Rainbow PUSH Coalition intends to be a part of the regulatory process leading to the closing of the EnronDynegy deal 
The organization which he founded owns Enron stock and shares in several other large Houstonbased energy firms 
Dynegy needs our participation to get approval Jackson said Monday 
The organizations interest in the acquisition of Enron by Dynegy is in assuring minority inclusion in any possible spinoffs employment contract commitments and EEOC rulings 
Jackson is here for the first annual energy summit conducted by the Houston bureau of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition Wall Street Project The summit continues today in the Hyatt Regency downtown 
Those companies played a role in this conference that suggests they are in touch with Jackson already On Monday he praised Enron head Ken Lays integrity although the Enron executive is on the other end of the political spectrum 
Lay and Dynegys chief executive officer Chuck Watson would have been at the groups energy summit if it werent for the announcement last week that turned everything topsyturvy Jackson said 
The coalition opened its Houston bureau in May on Smith Street so it can do research go to annual meetings and distribute information Jackson said 
Protests and boycotts are not part of the plan said WilliamPaul Thomas the bureau chief here 
The Rainbow PUSH Coalition which Jackson heads has taken an interest in energy and Houston in particular as demonstrated by his appearance at the Offshore Technology Conference here early this year 
Blacks and Hispanics have been locked out of employment upperlevel management and contracts Jackson said 
Jackson lamented the lack of emphasis on energy security now that the nations attention has turned to terrorists and anthrax 
He also took the opportunity in an interview to criticize President Bushs plans for stimulating the economy from the top down with a tax plan that will benefit large corporations to the tune of billions of dollars 
It must be bottom up Jackson said 
Onethird of Rainbow PUSH Coalitions idea for economic stimulation is travel vouchers worth  each and good for up to six months 
This would help employment in the hardhit travel and vacation industries during the holiday season he said

The  million of proceeds from asset sales does not include Azurix NA  that cash goes to Azuirx not Enron
PGE sale  not  billion in PS   million in PS and  million in common stock
The investor call was extended to  t  am and will focus more on the current business and financial stituation at Enron rather than the K filed last week

Questions of the Day

	Liquidity and counterparty activity  Transaction count on EnronOnline media and investors

For the past two years Enron has used day rolling averages for daily transaction counts and notional value for our wholesale trading activities on EnronOnline due to the normal variability in these numbers on a daytoday basis  Due to the unusual events of the last few weeks we provided some daily information  However we intend to again use rolling averages in all communications going forward  While we saw some decrease in volumes on EnronOnline at the end of last week due to the impending merger announcement volumes have returned to a normal range and are holding steady at a rolling average of  transactions with a notional value of  billion 


	Quantification of litigation media and investors
o	no specific comment on litigation
o	shareholder suits likely to be consolidated
o	 billion basket in merger agreement is designed to cover all Enron litigation ie not just shareholder litigation and the parties believe this will be sufficient

	Ken Lays compensation media and employees
o	Ken like many CEOs has a change in control provision in his contract and has had one for many years
o	Ken has elected to waive his right to payment under that provision


Messages of the Day

	Impact of merger on asset sales transactions eg Dabhol media 

Enron will continue with our asset sales program as previously announced  Those asset sales that have been announced include EcoElectrica CEG CEG Rio EOGIL and Portland General Electric as well as Azurix North America which closed on November   These transactions total  million plus PGE  billion cash  billion in preferred stock and  billion in debt

	Timing of funding from Chevron banks and rating agencies
o	Obligation   business days after filing HSR expected today expect funding to occur earlier

	Impact of transaction on specific areas eg Portland Japan Florida and other office locations  case by case

Attached is Jims prepared statement filed last night for todays House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee Chairman Barton hearing on reliability transmission incentives and siting issues  You will see we use the opportunity to make a plug for large RTOs as well  Jim will actually deliver a five minute oral summary  He is appearing as the EPSA witness in his capacity as chairman of the EPSA Regulatory Affairs Committee  There will be ten witnesses on the panel  Others will represent EEI NARUC APPA LPPC NRECA NERC David Cook ELCON Consumers for Fair Competition and GF Energy  We will provide a report following the hearing

 

 "
2001-11-14T12:35:16-08:00,"Some background information for the meeting with Mayor Brown

Brown won  of the vote to Sanchez  and is now in a run off with Sanchez  Sue Waldens perspective not surprisingly is that Brown will win and that campaign polls show him ahead among likely voters  African American turnout in the election was lower than expected but an active getoutthevote campaign could turn that around
Enron has supported the mayor with a  contribution  I would not recommend a further commitment under the current circumstances
If you want to discuss some of the positive accomplishments of his administration you could
Congratulate him on passage of his version of the light rail proposition
Compliment him on how he has responded to security issues since Sept  and his handling of flood relief
You should know that the Houston police were extremely helpful and responsive when we asked for assistance in connection with the October  threat to the Enron building
We have responded to the Citys RFP for energy service
EES made a presentation last week proposing a  year transaction
The city is opting for a  year transaction
That would require very detailed load data which is in Reliants possession
We have expressed concern that we are merely a stalking horse in the citys effort to do a deal with Reliant  We have said that we wont play on those terms
Separately we are working with the city on a demand side deal"
2001-11-14T15:37:22-08:00,"Ken talked with Barton  

Barton will not be signing the letter
The leadership met and decided since they are going to be in session anyway they would try to pass an electricity bill
Barton is now targeting a mid Dec markup
There is a meeting tomorrow at  between Wood and Tauzin Barton was supposed to be in Dallas  Ken urged him to stay for the meeting not clear if he will
I got the impression from Ken that part of the reason Barton is not sending the letter is that he thinks he will be passing a bill anyway not necessarily that he disagrees with the substance of the letter"

Subject	Merger Transition Teams

Steve

While Enrons management teams are reviewing actions plans for the upcoming six to nine months I understand that functional transition teams will be assembled to address the planned merger  I would like to register my strong interest in assisting any transition team where my skills could add value Prior to developing and supporting corporate as well as enterprise systems at Enron my career has spanned across General Electric Capital Services and ABB on a global basis Much of this experience has included system integration and change management  

Let me know if you have any questions to the above  Otherwise I wanted to let you know of my interest and desire in working towards a successful transition for Enron

John Sherriff and Michael Brown would like to send out the attached letter to employees in Europe this afternoon ie in the next  hours  I would be grateful if you would review it and let us have your approval as soon as possible

I have a couple of questions in relation to the content

  Can we refer to Wessex Water on our list of noncore assets in Europe

  Can we list the specific businesses under review as per the proposed draft below which is not included in the attached draft

The businesses currently under review in Europe are Global Markets except Coal Industrial Markets Metals Credit and the Wind Turbine manufacturing business  Also under review is the E Power generation asset development business in Japan  Given that these businesses are being identified in the media I would assume that we can although note that they dont appear in your message point summary received last night

A prompt response would be very much appreciated  Thanks

As you know we are about to reduce EMG workforce by over   I have spent the last couple of weeks spending one on one time with  many many employees who are not dealing well with the recent events and who are anticipating the worst for themselves and their families  I certainly commend the company on an orderly process but we need to make our professional counciling staff more visible and remind employees that this important service is available

I cannot stress enough how poor morale etc is over here and anything we can do to help will be greatly appreciated by the employees

Subject	Severance Issues   a suggestion

Steve

I have been told that the severance program is under review

As you well know many long term dedicated Enron employees who have been with the company for nearly a decade have seen their entire net worth completely wiped out  Retirement plans college funds etc have all evaporated  Since the average tenure for an Enron employee is rather short I believe that this subset is actually quite small  This small subset of employees has been wronged  I believe one way to cushion this blow is to alter the severance equation as follows


 weeks X number of employment years
 week X  each  of salary

Example one  year employee with an  salary      weeks severance

Example two  year employee with a  salary      weeks severance

This will accomplish two tasks one is to skew the severance towards the longer term employees the other is to reduce the total outlay so as not to overburden the company since the group receiving the higher severance is small I believe this is fair to both the employees and to our soontobe new management  Pls consider running this by management and or some focus groups if in fact the package is under review

I am not sure if I will see you before you get away but I am fairly sure I wont have an opportunity to say a proper farewell  

I want to tell you how much I have admired you and enjoyed working with you over the past several years  To me you have always epitomized what is good about Enron  I remember the first time I met you  you came to Jennifer Modisetts office to do a phone interview with a reporter on electricity deregulation  During the interview you never once sat down  I remember being impressed with how knowledgeable and wellspoken you were but mostly I remember being astounded by the passion you had for what you were doing  Your passion was contagious  it infected me and countless others  You made Enron more than a company you made it a cause 

Im sure youre leaving here with mixed emotions but know that you will be remembered fondly by so many people because you did great things here

Thanks for your leadership  It will be missed

Dear Steve

As per your voicemail I have reviewed the agreements between Enron Corp and Kissinger Associates Inc and Enron Corp and McLarty International LLC

I agree with your assessment that Enron can not legally terminate the agreement with Kissinger Associates Inc until May  

I also agree that we can terminate the relationship with McLarty International LLC upon thirty days written notice

Thus I have prepared two letters
	
	  Letter from you to Mr McLarty advising of Enrons termination of the Agreement effective November    It needs to be sent tomorrow November   

	  Letter from Mr Lay to Ambassador Paul Bremer advising of Enrons termination of the Agreement effective May  

I have tried to soften our standard notice  Please revise each letter as necessary  As per your voicemail I will be happy to tickle the  letter to Ambassador Bremer until April   However I did not find any language in the Agreement which would prevent us from providing notice of termination at this time

Thank you

		Subject	Algebra Information

		Dear Algebra Students

		You successfully completed Trimester I and were headed
into Trimester II As Im sure youve already noticed the material is
getting more and more challenging You should also be aware that I will
be expecting more and more higher level thinking as the year progresses
The Unit  Test is a good example of the thinking skills that Id like
to see The multiple choice questions were quite challenging and
required that you apply what wed learned Although the class average
was  on this test and many of you scored lower than you normally do
I think that we have to give ourselves credit for passing such a
challenging test The best news is that your portfolio grades will more
than make up for a lower test score One might say that I even planned
it that way  Now we have to get ready for the next test It will be
a similar test in style and difficulty and we wont be doing a
portfolio So you should take the Unit  Test and study the type of
questions that you missed Dont worryI know you can handle this By
the end of the year you will be a superb test taker and algebraist

		PS Dont forget to discuss your Unit  Test score with
your parents They had to take challenging tests in their day  and
they can help you prepare for the types of questions even if theyve
forgotten some of the math

Subject Potential Dynegy Transactions


Steve
 
I think you may have heard a request last week re working closely with Dynegy  I think we just need to treat them like other counterparties  Basically West Power would like to enter into arms length physical power and service transactions with Dynegy  My understanding is that Dynegy is a separate unrelated party until the merger closes  Therefore we can not collaborate with them commercially and our transaction policy is dictated by customary credit legal and risk management procedures  Is this correct   If so how do you feel about the following
 
An Enron customer wants to buy power and related services for one year  The customer requires Enron to post collateral  Enron does not want to post collateral but suggests that Enron can provide the product services to Dynegy and Dynegy can then sell to the customer  The Enron marketer calls the Dynegy marketer and proposes a back to back transaction   Dynegy adds a small service fee the Enron Dynegy contract is executed and a Dynegy Customer contract is executed  
 
This type of deal happens frequently  it is usually driven by the third party having better credit transmission access or a complementary service  We could do this with anyone but the obvious choice is Dynegy  customers think it makes sense and ultimately if we merge we have retained a customer  
 
Do you think this works
 
Regards
 
Chris"

Yesterday afternoon September  the Judge in the Northeast RTO mediation proceeding issued his report to the Commission on the day mediation session  Although not unexpected but still disappointing the Judge endorses the market design proposal of the New York and New England ISOs  This market design proposal encompasses a long drawn out process for discussing what the Northeast market should look like minimum  months before work begins to develop the new RTO  The target implementation date of the ISOs is November  but the proposal clearly states that this time frame is subject to extension if new design requirements are introduced  We believe the true intent of the ISOs is to delay indefinitely this process in order to retain the three existing ISO structures  A copy of the Judges report and the Business Plan are attached

One good aspect of the Judges report is that he asks in several areas of the report for Commission guidance  We too believe this is necessary  It became quite evident early in the mediation proceeding that we were not going to agree with the New York entities or the New England ISO on market design or governance  We argued that FERC intended the new market design to be primarily the PJM system with enhancements where possible  Others relying on the ambiguity in FERCs orders argued that FERC really intended to create a new system using PJM as the platform but pulling heavily from the other two ISOs regardless of time or complication of creating this new market  We need FERC direction on this and the Judge makes this clear

Background

The Judges primary goal of this day mediation process was simply to establish a business plan which lays out how and when a single Northeast RTO will be created  Enron along with many other participants opposed this approach arguing that we are wasting the  days given to us by the Commission  The Judge acknowledges in his report that there was significant opposition to his approach but he thinks it worked out perfectly  Although the majority of the Judges report and the business plan focuses mainly on process for creating the business plan he does discuss two substantive issues  market design and governance

Market Design

At the beginning of the mediation PJM NY and NE submitted a joint proposal for forming a single Northeast RTO  This proposal envisions a timeintensive approached designed to reach agreement by all stakeholders with an implementation date in  years Option Mof the Business Plan  This proposal is now supported by the New England and New York ISOs  PJM has its own approach see below  The New York transmission owners also submitted a proposal for implementing the new RTO in  years Option M of the Business Plan   PJM submitted an alternative proposal for creating and implementing a single Northeast RTO with a single dayahead and realtime energy market by November  Option M of the Business Plan  

We took the lead in creating a coalition of marketers generators PJM TOs industrials and other end use customers The One RTO Coalition advocating the creation of a single energy market based on PJMs system by December  but no later than May   Although we Enron believe PJMs November  time frame is too conservative the coalition supports Option M PJMs approach since it achieves the Coalitions goals albeit on a slower timetable  

As noted above the Judge endorses Option M in part because it has a builtin a process for determining Best Practices  Although PJM also conducted a best practices analysis the other ISOs and NY TOs do not agree with PJMs determinations of what practices from their ISOs are best practices  

The Judge acknowledges that support for Option M the PJM plan far outstrips the other options in diversity and extent of stakeholder support  However the Judge believes that the PJM option assumes the PJM platform can work in New York and New England even though there are more generation divestiture and load pocket issues in New York and New England than in PJM  The Judge states that impatience haste and greed should not be permitted to drive the RTO process at the expense of sound policy and that optimal RTO benefits should not be sacrificed in order to allow some to exploit more immediate economic opportunity in a sprint See Report page 

Governance

The other substantive issues we have discussed are governance  interim governance final governance board makeup and stakeholder process  The Judge opted to not endorse any one of the options proposed  instead he discusses the pros and cons of each option  Here again the Judge strongly urges the Commission to provide guidance to the participants on the Commissions preferred governance approach  The Judge also suggests that a settlement judge may be helpful in assisting stakeholders in finalizing governance procedures

PJM has stated that in order to meet its deadline of November  and certainly earlier PJM has to be in control of the implementation of the new RTO  PJM proposes that the new board be made up of board members from the existing ISOs   from PJM  from New York and  from New England  The Board elects a voting CEO assumed to be Phil Harris if the PJM proposal wins  

NY ISO New England ISO NY PSC NY TOs and New England TOs along with other entities primarily those who are afraid to cross New York PSC all support equal representation on the new Board  One proposal would have  board members from each ISO with a nonvoting CEO  The other proposal would have  board members from each ISO with  additional board members to be elected by stakeholders  

We support the PJM board makeup proposal to ensure a fast transition to a single Northeast RTO and energy market based on the PJM system

Post Mediation

The Judge in his report recommends that the Commission issue an order resolving as many of the issues in dispute as possible and then establish further proceedings under the auspice of a settlement judge  

The Judge urges the Commission to not accept comments from participants but he acknowledges that all participants want an opportunity to comment  We are working on two sets of comments now one on our own and one in conjunction with the One RTO Coalition  We will circulate drafts as soon as they are prepared

Although we are disappointed that the Judge did not endorse the PJM proposal we still believe that the Commission is intent on implementing a single northeast RTO as soon as possible and that the PJM proposal provides a wellreasoned even conservative approach to reaching that goal  Therefore even though the Judge sided with New York we are hopeful that the Commission will stick to its guns and go with the PJM proposal

Please call any one of us if you have any questions or would like to discuss the Report

It is unlikely that he will have any credible opposition in a primary  Late last spring there was a very well liked Republican state house member assistant majority leader Tim Pawlenty who was set to announce his candidacy and the day before his announcement Vice President Cheney called him and asked him not to run This created a great furor in the press and the party for a short time  Pawlenty agreed not to run citing his desire that the party remain united so that we have a better chance of beating Wellstone Although folks in the party were a tad miffed that Cheney was trying to be kingmaker they ultimately want to win more than they want to put up other candidates

Tim Pawlenty has now announced that he will run for Governor Jessie Ventura true to form has said that he wont make up his mind until next summer  If Ventura runs again he has a very good chance of being re elected he still has approval ratings in the  range

As I mentioned earlier  I dont believe that Wellstone will ever look at our issues in a rational or market oriented manner  I tend to think that his votes will be just the same regardless of whether we back another candidate or not

As an aside I believe the general consensus from my counterparts is the most beneficial route to take would be to allow those who already have an existing personal relationship with key faculty and deans to be at the forefront of any contact and or communications  Enrons credibility has been very publicly damaged by a few of Enrons key executives and schools are reluctant to have discussions with someone from our camp whom they dont already know

Dear Steven Kean
 
I am contacting you directly because you are the leader of Enrons educational initiatives  I am hoping you will take a few minutes to allow me to introduce myself and my company  I am sure you do not appreciate unsolicited mail therefore I apologize for this intrusion but I believe I you will be interested in what I have to say 
 
I am a founder in a fairly new company that is focused on a new technology for education  We are building oneonone relationships between major companies and universities  We are not a distance learning company  We do not provide content  We simply provide a unique platform for people to communicate with each other over great distances as though everyone involved were sitting in the same room
 
My goal today is to provide you with information that could allow Enron to have direct links into university classrooms  The possibilities include having Enron executives and managers attend a Stanford MBA program without having to travel to Palo Alto or attend a Harvard executive program without having to leave the workplace  Our plan is simple Enron picks the school of its choice we install digital classrooms at the school and at Enron  Through the use of digital technology these classrooms now become one  Enron employees now attend the same class in real time that is being taught at a school or university  The additional benefits to Enron are many less time lost all travel expenses saved employee moral and retention to name a few  This also allows key executives to upgrade their skills that would normally not want to be away from their job and family
 
My company Telanetix is building a network of virtual or digital classrooms around the country to link major universities with major corporations  Our digital classrooms are unlike anything you have seen  They appear as well appointed lecture rooms but the front and back walls are high resolution video screens There are no visible cameras or microphones  Everyone in each room sees everyone else people are lifesized there is no latency sound is directional no panning or zooming is used etc  The technology is transparent to the participants and this allows them to concentrate on each other  The impression of the participants is that they are all in one large room  No training is required to use the roomall that is required is for the participants to enter the room and start talking
 
The digital classrooms are so real in its effect that this technology is being readily accepted among elite school as a means for distant education  All classes or programs are exactly the same as being taught on campus today  Prospective students still apply to the college of choice and are admitted through the same process as students who plan to attend class on campus  All programs will have the full acceptance and accreditation of the school where the classes originate
 
When it is all said and done Telanetix becomes invisible  We simply link the likes of Stanford Harvard and MIT directly into corporate training centers  Enron employees would interact directly with the University and pay their tuition to the University  Telanetix collects its fees from the University and not the students
 
This technology is up and operating  Our partner TeleSuite Dayton Ohio has established about  conference rooms around the country with companies such as IBM COM CIGNA Price Waterhouse Coopers and AOLTime Warner  The University of Arizona and Duke University also have rooms  The University of Arizona is using a prototype of a teaching room to conduct two Executive MBA programs in the Silicon Valley COM from their Tucson campus  Duke uses the technology to communicate on administrative issues with their campus in Frankfurt Germany  Telanetix anticipates installing classrooms at Stanford University and the University of Maryland in the near future  Additionally we are linking overseas sites to this network in England and Australia
 
This technology is new and cuttingedge  I hope Enron will consider joining the small but growing list of companies that are bringing tier one education directly into the workplace
 
In addition to using the digital classroom for higher education all our business customers are using them for virtual conference rooms usually between executives in different locations  IBM for example has five of these rooms and is ordering five more because they have proven to be very cost effective as a means to reduce travel  Why  Because the conferencing is so profoundly real in its effect that the users feel as if they are all present in the same room  This is not videoconferencing  This is way beyond that
 
As executive vice president and chief of staff for Enron I sincerely appreciate your taking the time to read this  I believe that we have a value proposition for Enron to consider  I would very much like to demo our digital classroom to you and discuss the benefits and possibilities it might bring  Below I have attached a few pictures of the digital classroom
 
For more information please visit our web site at wwwtelanetixcom http  wwwtelanetixcom  
 
I look forward to your response
 
Sincerely

I have had surgery in the interior of my mouth specifically the lower right side of my tongue My dentist had suspected cancer and sent me to an oral surgeon who biopsied the area  This biopsy confirmed the dentists opinion and off I went to MD Anderson for examination MDA was more optimistic of diagnosis but said the area needed to be excised in any event which occured at MDA last Wednesday the th I have been at home recovering since It has been difficult to speak although it is now much better I will return to MDA in a month for a followup exam Hopefully the excision was complete and no additional follow up treatments will be necessary
 
I have missed several critical meetings and just havent been around but I wanted everyone to know that its not because Ive lost interest

Subject	Enron Management Conference  Home Video Project

  
The Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday November   at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio  While the business agenda is still being finalized there is one thing that is certain  we want to inject some humor into the event  The past year has been eventful and at times challenging for Enron and its employees  However its not in Enrons corporate fabric to focus on the past  Instead we want to look ahead ane even poke fun and laugh at ourselves  The Management Conference will provide a platform for just that

We want to challenge each of the business units to develop and submit a humorous Home Video to be presented at the Management Conference  The video can address any Enronrelated topic that your business unit chooses  Some ideas include
Accounting Procedures
Cost Cutting
Deal Making
Innovation
Management Changes
PRC
Public Relations
Reorganizations
Stock Price
Trading Traders

There are a few rules to follow
 The videos should be no more than five minutes long
 Business units should spend as little as possible on the videos and no more than   Innovision Communications Beth Stier has agreed to work with any business unit to help them create an original inexpensive video  Innovision can be contacted at 
 The videos should be fun but not disparaging  They should adhere to Enrons values of respect integrity communication and excellence
  By Monday October  business units need to notify me of their intentions to submit a video  To avoid duplication business units will also need to identify a topic they intend to address
 To ensure inclusion in the Management Conference agenda videos need to be submitted to me by Friday November 
  Awards will be granted for creativity and humor  The first annual and soontobecoveted Enny will also be awarded for Best Overall Video

If you have any questions about the Home Video project please contact myself or Mary Clark  Good luck and happy filming

Steve

I and my fellow HR VPs are volunteering on Monday to spend the first  hours of our day checking ids and that security pass pictures match individuals using them before letting them in the building In fact I am planning to order some peaked caps and tshirts with SECURITY emblazened on them today Robert and I are also going to Best Buy tomorrow to pick up a couple of those hand held metal detector wands to waive aroundI could go on

The security stinks our employees do not feel comforted and we need to do something about it I am prepared to do it myself

Good Morning Kalen

Since the attack on America last week   Life as we know it will never be the same  Although as a nation  individuals we are trying to recover  put the pieces back we know the journey ahead will be hard  especially after what Bush discussed last night  I bring this up for several reasons as an American  an Enron employee  After talking w  Enron employees about terrorists attacks possible cell groups in our own back yardwe are fearfulthis is an understatement  However we know as employees the importance of getting back to the work Enron is paying us to do  How do we balance the two  I have some ideas I have shared with Leasa  JudyId like to suggest them to you as I feel they are steps we can put into place to help our Enron employees feel safe

Lets have an evacuation drill
 On your floor know where the nearest stairwell s are located
 Someone assigned to a handicapped employeein the event of an evacuationthis person would ensure they get out safely
 Update floor  fire wardenwho are they  Leasa told me that the one on our floor is from 
 Have one or two contacts in each group that would be responsible for making sure everyone knew what was happening in the event of an evacuation  people come in @ different times etc
 Vent  talk meetings w  managers over lunch  see paragraph  for explanation

Also I do not think it is unreasonable to think some of our employees are suffering from  or will suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome I propose that managers  leaders of groups hold a vent  talk meetingover lunchwhere employees can feel free to talk about their concerns fears anger etcIt is so important that we do this  If not some of the repercussions may be people resigning for fear of working downtown  in a highrise etc Judy  I talked about this 

I feel this is an opportunity for HR to really make a difference  contribute   have a strong impact in assuring our employees we are taking active measures to ensure their safety  want to address their feelings    Id like to know what your thoughts are on this  If youd like to discuss the further Id welcome the opportunity

Thank you for your time

Johanna

Here is the latest draft of the Lay It On the Line memo from Ken  Cindy made some signficant changes this morning  Some of the action items removed were mandatory vacation leadership training online communications training the function of Employee Relations and the employee task force   Mary and I agree that as it stands now there is not nearly enough meat to warrant a communication to employees  Sending out a memo with a theoretical approach and few significant tangible action items will backfire  As an FYI I was told by several people including one in HR that employees are reacting very sensitively to any changes that are announced  I think we should wait to communicate this until we have solid positive action items

You are correct  This is not a new issue but it seems to resurface on a regular basis  The issue has been pointed out regularly the first time in connection with the license and regularly thereafter and each time the business has said not to worry if they cant cut a deal with New Power they will just pay the  MW  EES has assumed it will pay the  MW since day one

Harry and Gloria

Jim Keller and I have indeed dealt with this issue in the past it actually came up at the time we were applying for our TX marketer license 

 It is my understanding and Jim please comment if my information is stale that we were going to choose the option set forth in Sec g which allows us to make a payment into the System Benefit Fund  This approach was discussed with Dennis Benevides and then I believe with Don Black and they were OK with our pursuing this course in lieu of having TNPC provide service to residentials on our behalf 

 Please call me if you have any questions

Residential Obligation
Section g of Senate Bill  provides that for any REP serving an aggregate load in excess of  MW  of the load must consist of residential customers A REP can fulfil this requirement by
 Demonstrating that it directly serves residential load amounting to  of its total load
 That another REP serves the residential load on its behalf or
 It pays  dollar per MWH of required  load into the System Benefit Fund
 EES can fulfil its obligation by entering into an agreement with New Power to serve residential load on its behalf or can pay the  per MWH penalty
There is an annual compliance reporting requirement and EES can demonstrate compliance if it has an agreement with New Power

EES Contract
For price to beat customers the utilities have by Commission rule the obligation to allow customers to come and go without restraint for the  year period conmmencing    The Commission concern may be that Enron will abuse this provision by gaming the system The Enron contracts as currently written are within the rules as approved by the Commission Until the utilities move to amend the relevant rules the Commission can only exercise its displeasure by appropriate oversight and enforcement to determine what conduct amounts to abuse and gaming I think it will ultimately be a question of degree and pattern of switching The onus will be on the affiliated REPs to prove abuse and gaming Fundamentally it is in the best interest of the market to allow customers to come and go Customer mobility is the best customer protection in a competitive market Besides a restraint on customer mobility could have a chilling effect on competition as it will increase customer inertia The Commission will carefully weigh any course of action to insure that they achieve a reasonable balance For larger than MW customers they can agree to long term contracts and a restriction on their ability to come and go

Everyone   

I was just informed by EPMI that there may be a requirement for Retail Energy Providers in ERCOT to serve a certain mix of residential rate class industrial rate class customers once a certain industrial threshold is crossed  Mw of industrial rate class load  

EWS has not set it itself up to monitor such requirements  Therefore I cannot comment on the accuracy or details of this requirement  However it is something we definitely need to look into  In addition we EPMI EWS are getting feedback from the TX PUC that they are not pleased with how they see the pilot and the market structure unfolding  Specifically they are not pleased with retail energy providers contracts that contemplate the right to switch between direct access and tariff and visaversa  We will monitor and need to get more clarity on how the PUC intends to address their displeasure

On the residential requirement front someone needs to address this  Specifically is this true  If so what rate classes are considered industrial vs commercial  Is there a similar requirement for commercial load  Is TI considered industrial  Do we already have industrial customers in our portfolio  Who in EES tracks and monitors issues like these as we enter markets

Mike Curry is in the process of tracking this info down from an EPMI perspective as they are focusing on more of the pure large industrial customers  We will share any information Mike receives with the EES group

Due to recent events Enron will be increasing security at its facilities around the world  As part of this increased security effort beginning Wednesday morning September  the following access control procedures will be instituted at the Enron Building in Houston and where applicable at other Enron facilities

	As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Building a guard will match the photo on 	the badge to the bearer

	All employees will be required to display their badges while in any Enron facility  The badge must be attached to 	the front of the employee at some point between the waist and the shoulders

	Employees who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Building US 	drivers	 license US or foreign passport or some form of US federal state or local identification 

	Visitors to the Enron Building must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must 	completely fill out the visitor card  Visitors without a valid photo ID US drivers license US or foreign passport 	or some form of US federal state or local identification will not be allowed access to the Enron Building

	Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times

	Visitors to the Enron Building will be met in the lobby by an Enron employee or badged contractor signed into a 	visitors log at 	the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor and escorted to their appointment  	At the conclusion of the appointment the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged 	contractor the visitor badge collected and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the 	escorting employee or badged contractor

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at Enron  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment we expect the inconvenience to decrease  We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees 	   "

Subject	WTO Energy Services Coalition Lives  Sort of

As you may know Enron has ceased all funding of the efforst made by the Energy Services Coalition an entity that it was instrumental in establishing  However Linda recognised that we could not completely abandon our involvement with the ESC and the USTR effort to negotiate an energy services section of GATS  Otherwise Enron would risk damaging its reputation within USTR and among the other members of the coalition  In fact carol Ballassa of USTR spoke with me privately about her concern and alledegedly Zoellicks concern that Enron would abandon the effort Therefore Linda set me on the task to rationalize our ESC involvement

Upon further scrutiny of the ESC effort it became apparent that the GATS effort on energy services had absolutely nothing to do with deregulation or liberalisation of the energy sector  In fact mention of open access  particularly gas pipelines  caused some of the ESC members to break out into a cold sweat  Unfortunately few if any of the energy services that could be provided by Enron can be offered in a monopoly market  Therefore there was little for Enron to gain in these negotiations unless the deregulation was adressed as a prerequisite to opening trade in energy services

I met privately with the USTR negotiating team and made the case that deregulation had to part of the negotiating agenda  Otherwise I told her that there would be little to gain for Enron and we would not be an active participant as a result

We met today with USTR and other members of the coalition and in fact deregulation was on the USTR negotiating agenda  GE and Enron supported the way in which USTR would raise the issue in negotiations but other members of the ESC from the oil and gas sector objected strenuosly to pipeline access provisions  As it stands the ESC will split or fold on this provision  If the USTR agrees to water down its negotiating provision they know that Enron will likely leave the ESC  If the provision remains then the USTR effort may actually prove beneficial to Enron in the long run Regardless of the outcome Enrons time and expenditure on this effort will be minimal to nonexistant

Subject	RTO week message

How we frame RTO week could have a big impact on what if anything happens legislatively between now and the end of the session  While we all realize that what Pat Wood laid out last week was of enormous import I dont think we can afford to allow that to become the conventional wisdom  

In fact that will be the message of our opponents Pat Wood turned the world upside down last week  He went off in a radical direction that he doesnt even possess the authority to go in  You have to do something before his December th deadline

I believe we have to consistently send the message that he went in a direction thats perfectly consistent with previous commission orders fitting with previously set timeframes  Its the action youd expect a new chairman to take in order to get his arms around a big and possibly contentious issue  

We should point out that he took a very middleoftheroad approach  We can contrast what Pat Wood laid out versus a more radical approach that he didnt take

The more often we can aggressively drive media coverage and send signals in the press especially in DC  that this is orderly business as usual with no need for outside intervention the more likely we are to avoid legislative action

On top of the day to day activity to drive this message I think we should look at some media briefings probably a combination of conference calls and oneonone interviews  Sooner would be better than later given the truncated legislative schedule"

The message from Ken about increasing costs should be modified I think  First I think we may be overstating it to say that the cost increases for future periods threaten the health of the company   I know its a play on the health theme but I think it comes off as unnecessarily alarmist  Second and on a related point I think we should be a bit clearer that we cant keep this up and absent some major change in the underlying cost of health care we are likely to increase the employee contribution in  and beyond  Finally I think Greg Whalley and Mark Frevert should see this part of the message at least after we make changes

Subject	Enron Net Works  Budget Process

The  Enron Net Works budget will for the first time combine allocations to business units for four key services  Enron Online IT Infrastructure Risk Management Operations and IT Maintenance and Development  We are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive  

We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works  Some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and October   Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget

Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year  Additions to the  ENW budget are Operations for EA EIM and EGM  Operations IT Maintenance and Development and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the    budget as well  The  budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year   Any comparison of ENWs  versus  budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant  

For further detail for each business unit ENWs  expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business units lines of business products or commodities in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business  

The detail that is being provided to business units for IT costs delineates licensing fees system maintenance costs and new development costs  Detail on each IT development project identifies the purpose business sponsor line of business in progress or planned designation expense and capital spend system impacted and estimated completion date   In order to finalize IT project budgets decisions will be required from the business units on which projects to undertake in    

If you have questions about the ENW budgets as we are working with you to finalize them  please call one of us
